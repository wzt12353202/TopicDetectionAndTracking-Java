Arsenal's French striker Robert Pires is set to miss their Premiership 
clash at Aston Villa on Saturday. An injury to his right ankle, picked 
up in the FA Cup win at Chelsea a week ago, has failed to heal and 
he missed France's game against Malta on Saturday. He has also been 
ruled out of Wednesday's clash with Israel in Sicily. Arsenal said 
Pires, 30, had treatment in the south of France and was due back at 
Highbury later Tuesday for further checks. He was expected to be fit 
for the FA Cup semi-final against Sheffield United on Saturday week. 
Pires missed last year's World Cup and the run-in to the English title 
after rupturing knee ligaments at the back end of last season. But 
he has bounced back impressively this season. Arsenal's French manager 
Arsene Wenger brought him to Highbury from Marseille in 2000 in an 
eight million pound (13 million dollar) move. bur/rw/ak Fbl-ENG-Pr-Arsenal-Pires

North Korea accused the United States Tuesday of stepping up spy flights 
over the Stalinist state in preparation for an invasion once the war 
with Iraq ends, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. Yonhap quoted 
North Korea's official Radio Pyongyang as saying the US military flew 
220 reconnaissance flights over the communist country in March, 40 
more than the previous month. "This shows the US imperialists are 
trying to turn their spearhead of aggression to our republic after 
the war in Iraq," said the North's state radio station, monitored 
by Yonhap in Seoul. The US military conducted surveillance flights 
using RC-135, U-2, EP-3 and RC-7Bs spy planes backed by E-3 early 
warning aircraft, as well as radar-evading F-117 fighters. North Korea's 
state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) also blasted US surveillance 
missions and joint military exercises in South Korea as a prelude 
to war against Pyongyang. "The aerial espionage and war exercises 
go to clearly prove that the US is going to invade the DPRK (North 
Korea) at the end of the Iraqi war," the agency said in a dispatch 
monitored in Seoul. The North has repeatedly maintained that the United 
States has been preparing a pre-emptive strike on North Korea's suspected 
nuclear facilities, which have been at the center of growing regional 
tensions. It has frequently denounced on-going US-South Korean military 
exercises, which the US military describes as routine and defensive 
in nature. The nuclear crisis erupted nearly six months ago when Washington 
accused Pyongyang of running a secret nuclear weapons program. Last 
month, four North Korean MiG-19 fighter jets intercepted a US reconnaissance 
plane over international waters 249 kilometers (150 miles) off the 
North's eastern coast in what the United States described as a dangerous 
provocation. Washington has denied charges that it plans to invade 
the North and said it is seeking a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

BRUSSELS, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell could 
hold discussions on Iraq with European Union foreign ministers in 
Brussels on Thursday, a diplomatic source in the Belgian capital told 
AFP. Contacts were being made on Tuesday with a view to setting up 
the meeting, which has been requested by the US administration, the 
source said. The US Secretary of State is set to arrive in Turkey 
later on Tuesday for discussions on the US-led war on Iraq. He will 
then travel on to Brussels for talks on Thursday with NATO and three 
senior European officials -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, 
European External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten and Greek Foreign 
Minister Georges Papandreou, whose country holds the rotating presidency 
of the 15-nation bloc. The US State Department has said Powell hopes 
to discuss issues related to the invasion of Iraq, now in its 13th 
day, and about the post-war future of the oil-rich country. He could 
raise in Brussels the possibility of involving countries other than 
the United States and Britain in stabilising Iraq and maintaining 
order after the end of the war. Washington's strategy in Iraq has 
deeply divided its European partners and put strains on transatlantic 
relations. But the 15 EU members agreed at a summit on March 20-21 
that the United Nations should play a central role in Iraq during 
and after the war. European calls for a UN-supervised administration 
in Iraq are becoming more strident, amid concerns that Washington 
may cut non-US companies out of reconstruction contracts. phv/gil/yad

Oil prices slipped in early trading here on Tuesday after a strike 
in producer Nigeria was called off, though continuing disruption of 
the country's exports and worries about the war in Iraq limited losses. 
The price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for May delivery 
dropped 28 cents per barrel to 26.90 dollars here. GNI trader Kevin 
Blemkin attributed the fall to news that Nigeria's principal labour 
movement had suspended a strike over pay after reaching an agreement 
with the government on workers' demands. The three-day stoppage was 
to have begun on Tuesday, but an overnight meeting with government 
officials led to its suspension, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) spokesman 
Owei Lakemfa told AFP. "We held a fruitful meeting with President 
Olusegun Obasanjo, secretary to the government, and the labour minister. 
And we agreed to suspend the strike pending the resolution of the 
dispute," he said. More than 800,000 barrels of oil per day, 40 percent 
of Nigeria's production, has been slashed from exports because of 
violent civil unrest ahead of general elections on April 12. Analysts 
noted that even though the strike had been called off, exports from 
Nigeria are unlikely to recover yet. Commerzbank analyst David Thomas 
said the end to the strike "won't have any impact on production for 
those areas where Western oil companies withdrew their staff." "You 
still have Nigerian oil production below normal because of the situation 
there ahead of the election," he added. There was little sign of an 
end to the violence at the weekend, when political thugs attacked 
an opposition rally in Nigeria's troubled Niger Delta, driving activists 
into a river and hacking them with machetes, eye-witnesses said. pf-dr/pw/hd

French engineering group Alstom said on Tuesday it had received a 
takeover bid, responding to rumours that had sent its share price 
rocketing in early trading. However, the company said it was sceptical 
about the seriousness of the offer, which was made in the name of 
an unheard-of company. "Alstom confirms having received a letter from 
a company calling itself MJ Global Acquisition, declaring its ambition 
to acquire the totality of Alstom's capital," Alstom said in a statement. 
However, the letter "raised doubts about the seriousness of the bid", 
it added. The price of Alstom shares surged by 15.6 percent to 1.62 
euros (1.76 dollars) in early trading here on Tuesday on rumours that 
Dutch financier Mattew Jean might make a takeover bid. Later the shares 
fell back slightly to 1.60 euros in mid-morning trading, still up 
14.2 percent on Monday's close. Brokerage CDC Ixis said in an earlier 
note to its customers: "A Dutch financier is reported to have made 
an offer valuing the share at 2.0 euros (2.17 dollars) which the Alstom 
board has rejected. He is believed to be about to offer 2.5 euros 
(2.72 dollars) per share." The company is expected to report a loss 
of about 1.3 million euros (1.4 million dollars) for the year to March, 
is weighed down by debt of 5.0 billion euros (5.45 billion dollars) 
and intends to raise 600 million euros (654 million dollars) in new 
capital to strengthen strained cash resources. Alstom, which builds 
power stations, high-speed-train rolling stock and ships, recently 
announced a change of strategy to strengthen its finances. New chief 
executive Patrick Kron has announced that the group will raise 3.0 
billion euros (3.27 billion dollars) through asset sales by 2005.

The deadly outbreak of viral pneumonia is casting a dark cloud over 
Asian economies, with growth rates this year likely to be slashed 
by up to 1.5 percentage points, an investment bank said Tuesday. "We 
are of the view that economic growth will slow in Asia as a result 
of the decline in the two pillars of Asia's economies -- tourism and 
private consumption," BNP Paribas Peregrine said in a report. The 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) erupted in southern China's 
Guangdong province in November, spread to Hong Kong and onwards to 
other parts of the world, killing at least 60 people so far. The virus 
has so far claimed 15 lives in Hong Kong and infected 610, with tourism 
and aviation industries throughout Asia suffering as travellers choose 
to stay home. "The SARS epidemic will cast a long dry spell on tourism 
and its associated industries. We expect the airline, hotel, trade, 
retail and property sectors to be adversely affected by the pneumonia 
problem," BNP Paribas Peregrine said. However, some sectors such as 
supermarkets, newspapers and television stations would benefit from 
the public preference to stay home, it added. The cuts to economic 
growth forecasts for the region have also been made as it becomes 
clear the US-led war in Iraq will last longer than initially expected. 
This is a bigger factor than SARS in some countries such as South 
Korea where BNP Paribas has cut its growth forecast to 4.0 percent 
from 5.1 percent. But for much of Asia, the virus is arguably a bigger 
problem, the report said. The biggest growth forecast cut is for Singapore, 
which is heavily reliant on tourism. Growth this year is now seen 
at 2.5 percent, down from 4.0 percent. Hong Kong's expected growth 
has been cut to 0.9 percent from 1.5 percent, Taiwan to 3.9 percent 
from 4.3 percent and Malaysia to 4.0 percent from 4.7 percent. Elsewhere 
in Southeast Asia, Thailand's growth is seen easing to 3.5 percent 
from 4.0 percent forecast earlier, Indonesia is seen falling to 3.9 
percent from 4.3 percent and the Philippines is is estimated at 3.0 
percent, down from 3.5 percent. BNP Paribas Peregrine is maintaining 
its 7.4 percent growth forecast for China, which is less dependent 
on tourism, but said the estimate could be cut by 0.2 to 1.0 percentage 
points if the situation worsens. bro/dv Health-pneumonia-Asia-economy

The office of the Iraqi president denied Tuesday reports from the 
Pentagon that members of Saddam Hussein's family were trying to flee 
the country. "The small family of our leader Saddam Hussein is part 
of the extended family that is the Iraqi people and as Saddam Hussein 
has tied his fate to the fate of his people ... the fate of his family 
cannot be separated from that of the extended family," a spokesman 
for the president's office said, quoted by state television. The denial 
came after US Defense Department spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said: 
"We have seen evidence that family members are fleeing the country, 
or trying to flee the country." However Clarke admitted US intelligence 
had seen "neither hide nor hair" of Saddam or his two sons since bombing 
raids on his compound on the first day of the war on March 20. They 
have however appeared on Iraqi state television and ministers have 
denied reports they have been killed or wounded. ezz/bp/dab Iraq-war-Saddam-family

Romanian international striker Viorel Moldovan said Tuesday he is 
to leave French side Nantes at the end of the season. The 30-year-old 
Moldovan arrived on the Atlantic coast in July 2000 and his goals 
played a key role in helping the Canaries to the French first division 
title that season. But this season he has been struggling with injuries 
and out of favour, starting in only 10 games and scoring just four 
goals. "I've accepted that Nantes no longer want to keep me," said 
Moldovan, adding that he was hopeful he could find another club in 
France or move back to Switzerland where he previously played with 
Neuchatel and Grasshoppers. bur/ak/rw Fbl-FRA-Nantes-Moldovan

HONG KONG, April 1 (AFP) - AOL Time Warner said Friday that its Mandarin-language 
entertianment channel, China Entertainment Television Broadcast (CETV) 
has been granted a license to extend its reach nationwide across China. 
AOL Time Warner said in a statement that China's State Administration 
of Radio, Film and Television has authorized CETV to be broadcast 
from China's central satellite platform, allowing CETV to expand its 
distribution to hotels and other authorized receipients across China 
via the Sinosat satellite. Previously, CETV was only licenced to distribute 
its channel to cable homes in southern China. Acquired by AOL Time 
Warner in June 2000, CETV was re-launched in February 2001 by Turner 
Broadcasting System, with a fresh programming line up. Turner is an 
AOL Time Warner company which is a leading provider of programming

The US military has suspended its training program for Iraqi exiles 
in Hungary after a second group of recruits completed the course and 
left for the Gulf, officials said Tuesday in a statement. "The US 
military's current program to train Iraqi opposition volunteers has 
been suspended with the departure of the second group of Free Iraqi 
Forces in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom," Major General David 
Barno, the training task force commander, said in the statement. The 
trainees were coordinating and providing humanitarian assistance in 
Iraq, said the statement, which did not say why the training program 
was suspended. Hungary, a NATO member, has allowed the US army to 
train up to 3,000 Iraqi exiles at its southern Taszar military base. 
The United States has said the Iraqis will not be serving with frontline 
combat units but would help the US military and humanitarian groups 
liaise with the local population in Iraq after the war. A first group 
of Iraqi exiles, most of whom had been living in North America, completed 
the program in January and has been deployed with US forces in the 
Gulf region. The second group counted about 26 people who were recruited 
in Western Europe. According to US officials in Washington, the exiles 
were trained for two weeks in the use of a 9-mm pistol, the use of 
chemical, biological and nuclear protective gear, basic first aid, 
map reading, military customs and courtesy, and the rules of war, 
including the Geneva Conventions. The second half of the course was 
devoted to civil affairs training. est/yad Iraq-war-Hungary

The US-led war in Iraq could serve as an impetus to conclude the World 
Trade Organisation trade liberalistion talks despite current divisions, 
EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said Tuesday. Lamy, on a week-long 
tour of three Southeast Asian countries, said the tensions associated 
with the war could help galvanize WTO members into action on trade 
reform due by the end of 2004 in the Doha round of talks. "I believe 
the geopolitical tensions are there, but that they can work on the 
positive side to reinforce the view that the economy of this world 
needs good news," Lamy told a press briefing here. "The multilateral 
system is available in WTO with rules, with disciplines, with enforcement 
mechanisms, and what we need in the present circumstances is more 
of that rather than less of that." "Hence the sort of added impetus 
we believe it (war) should give to the ongoing negotiations." Lamy 
said European trade officials have remained in close contact with 
their American counterparts to assure continuity on trade issues despite 
the political differences between some EU members and the United States 
over the war. "We would go on addressing the frictions we have here 
and there with particular care so that there is no spillover of trans-Atlantic 
political tension into the trade field," he said. WTO members failed 
Monday to meet the March 31 deadline to establish parameters for talks 
on further liberalising farm trade, a key element of the overall trade 
liberalisation plan. Lamy concluded two days of talks Tuesday with 
senior Thai politicians and economic officials. He stressed the EU 
and Thailand were still confident that the Doha round would be completed 
on schedule by the end of 2004. mlm/sb/bro Iraq-war-Thailand-EU-WTO

Thailand's health ministry on Tuesday declared the killer virus spreading 
across the globe as a serious communicable disease, an emergency move 
authorising the quarantine of suspected carriers for 14 days. The 
declaration "will enable public health officials to quarantine suspects 
who have returned from cities or countries where the disease has broken 
out for 14 days," Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan told reporters. 
All people returning from regional areas affected by Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) -- mainly Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore, 
Vietnam and Taiwan -- should quarantine themselves for 14 days, Sudarat 
said. They should not attend work or places of study and should isolate 
themselves from family members while following ministry hygiene guidelines. 
"We have to ask for full cooperation from the Thai people. We don't 
want to be in the same situation as Hong Kong and Singapore," she 
said. The health ministry has also asked staff in hotels with tourists 
from outbreak areas to don masks, follow strict personal hygiene regulations 
and inform the ministry if guests appear to be suffering from the 
disease. The mysterious illness has now infected more than 1,700 people 
in 15 countries. According to a tally compiled by AFP, the worldwide 
death toll from SARS stands at 62, with 34 deaths in China, 15 in 
Hong Kong, four in Vietnam, Canada and Singapore, and one in Thailand. 
The Thai cabinet on Tuesday banned government and state enterprise 
officials from travelling to Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Vietnam 
and Canada. The health ministry meanwhile boosted its medical staff 
at Bangkok's international airport from 10 to 15 per shift to screen 
incoming passengers, the health ministry's permanent secretary Vallop 
Thaineau said. Ten medical staff also remained on stand-by to supervise 
travellers requiring quarantine at the adjacent military airport, 
he said. Vallop admitted that the latest stringent measures would 
have negative repercussions on the Thai tourism industry. "The public 
health ministry is coordinating with the Air Force Commander to alert 
the public to the situation, and screen and separate passengers who 
may be affected with SARS. It's necessary although it will affect 
tourism," he said. No plans were afoot to ban tourists from outbreak 
countries, he added. Government spokesman Sita Divari revealed that 
Thailand's multi-billion dollar tourism industry was already suffering. 
"The tourism minister reported to the cabinet that tourist arrivals 
have dropped between 10 and 20 percent," Sita said. One person has 
died of SARS in Thailand but there has been no transmission here, 
according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO doctor Carlo 
Urbani, who first alerted colleagues to SARS in Vietnam, died in Bangkok 
Saturday. Health ministry officials said Tuesday two other cases were 
being monitored on suspicion of being SARS. One person is being monitored 
in a Bangkok hospital while a Thai national who had returned from 
work in Hong Kong to visit relatives in southern Songkhla and fell 
ill there was in isolation. SARS erupted in southern China's Guangdong 
province in November, from where it spread to Hong Kong and has since 
been taken worldwide in unprecedented fashion by airline passengers.

Manchester United defender Laurent Blanc is set to retire at the end 
of the season. The 37-year-old told MUTV he did not expect an extension 
to his current contract which expires in the summer. "Manchester United 
existed before me and it will exist after me," he said. "I don't know 
what I will do next year but I think I need a break." Many pundits 
questioned the wisdom of Blanc's arrival at Old Trafford on a free 
transfer from Inter Milan 18 months ago. The Frenchman is now clearly 
past his best and his lack of pace was badly exposed by Albert Luque 
against Deportivo La Coruna in Spain last month. However, manager 
Alex Ferguson believes Blanc's presence on the training ground can 
provide the younger members of his defence with valuable lessons which 
they can take into the remainder of their own careers. Blanc won the 
World Cup and European championship with France before quitting international 
football in 2000. He started his career with French Second Division 
side Montpellier in 1983 and enjoyed promotion to the top flight after 
the 1986/87 season. His performances in the heart of their defence 
as well as in front of the opposition goal - he scored eighteen goals 
in 34 games in 1986/87 and fifteen in 34 in 1988/89 - caught the eye 
of the French national team and he made his international debut against 
Ireland in February 1989. He won the French Cup with Montpellier the 
same season. Blanc faced United in his last season with Montpellier, 
impressing all as the Reds won over two legs on their way to European 
Cup Winners' Cup glory in 1991. Laurent moved to Italy in 1991/92, 
playing for Napoli for a season, before returning to France with Nimes. 
After a season with Nimes he moved on to St Etienne, where he scored 
18 goals in two seasons. From there it was on to Auxerre for a year, 
when he was part of a French League and Cup Double winning side. Next 
stop on Blanc's career path was Spain's Primera Liga, where he played 
alongside Ronaldo at Barcelona under Bobby Robson. A fantastic 1996 
season saw Barca win the Spanish Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup while 
finishing second in the League. But the next year he joined Olympique 
Marseille. It was while with Marseille that Blanc was the mainstay 
of the World Cup winning French side in 1998. Having played in all 
but one game up until the final, Blanc was banned for the match against 
Brazil. He was harshly sent off in the semi when Croatia's Slaven 
Bilic feigned injury. Laurent switched back to Serie A and Inter Milan 
in August 1999, before adding to his incredible medal collection by 
winning Euro 2000 with 'Les Bleus.' He retired from international 
football after a friendly against England on 2 September 2000. Blanc 
signed for United in August 2001, replacing Jaap Stam in the heart 
of the Old Trafford defence. bur/rw/ak Fbl-ENG-ManUtd-FRA-Blanc

Indonesian shares closed flat Tuesday as late interest in telecoms 
stocks reversed earlier losses, dealers said. They said selling dominated 
the market amid worries about the regional Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and fears of a prolonged war in Iraq. The 
Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index ended up 0.051 points or 0.01 
percent at 398.055 on volume of 129.9 million shares worth 127.192 
billion rupiah (14.3 million dollars). The rupiah was at 8,883/8,888 
against the dollar compared with Monday's close of 8,900/8,905. Panin 
Securities dealer Nico Suherman said overall sentiment remained weak 
amid prevailing concerns over the Iraq war and the increasing effects 
of SARS. He said the losses were offset by late bargain-hunting in 
selected blue chips, notably Telkom, as some investors considered 
them undervalued. Telkom closed up 24 rupiah at 3,650 while Indosat 
was up 50 at 7,650. Astra International was up 50 at 2,550. Gudang 
Garam traded flat at 7,400 while Sampoerna lost 50 to 2,900. Bank 
Central Asia was up 25 at 2,225. bur/sm/dv Stocks-Indonesia

British Prime Minister Tony Blair has postponed a visit to China that 
had been scheduled for later this month, Chinese officials and the 
British embassy said Tuesday. "The British side said they wanted to 
postpone the visit because of certain reasons," foreign ministry spokesman 
Liu Jianchao said. "As to the specific reasons, you can ask the British 
government, but it's certainly not because of Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS)." A spokesman at the British embassy in Beijing said 
the visit has been postponed, but also said it had nothing to do with 
SARS, the deadly atypical pneumonia which has killed at least 62 people 
around the world. "He's going to come later in the year," the British 
embassy official said. He declined to say why the trip was being postponed 
and whether it was due to the Iraq war. cs/ph/cl China-Britain

Around 300 demonstrators calling for resignations over a city council 
vote-buying scandal clashed with police on Tuesday. Su Ying-kui, a 
parliamentarian from the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), had his glasses 
knocked off when he and several other TSU legislators led a charge 
at police lines guarding the council of Taiwan's second city, Kaohsiung. 
"Piggy councillors, step down!" chanted the group, which brought several 
pigs along to the protest. Inside the council building, some 30 deputies 
held their first scheduled meeting after Independent speaker Chu An-hsiung 
was detained over alleged vote-buying in city council polls in December. 
A city councillor presided over the meeting after deputy speaker Tsai 
Sung-hsiung was also taken into police custody on the same allegations. 
The scandal broke on December 25 when the 44 newly-elected Kaohsiung 
councillors voted in a secret ballot to elect Chu as the speaker and 
Tsai as the deputy speaker. Chu and Tsai, political independents labelled 
as key figures in Taiwan's notorious money politics, both received 
the votes of 11 Kuomintang deputies, six People First Party deputies 
and eight independents. Chu reportedly paid 10 million Taiwan dollars 
(287,000 dollars) to a number of councillors in exchange for their 
votes and Tsai paid up to half that amount. Deputies from the ruling 
Democratic Progressive Party had also taken bribes to vote for Chu, 
but were ordered to return the cash after intervention from President 
Chen Shui-bian, newspaper reports said. A total of 33 deputies from 
the three parties and independents were either questioned or had their 
homes searched. Calls for the resignation of the implicated councillors 
have been mounting. None of the councillors have been charged over 
the matter. cty/sdm/th Taiwan-politics-corruption-protest

The prime ministers and foreign ministers of Turkey and Greece will 
discuss the divided island of Cyprus on April 8, on the sidelines 
of a summit of Balkan countries, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan said on Tuesday. Turkey will not give up its efforts to end 
the long-running division of Cyprus just because its rival Cypriot 
Greek and Turkish communities failed last month to agree on a United 
Nations plan to reuinte the Mediterranean island, Erdogan told parliamentarians 
from his ruling Justice and Development Party. "We want to make new 
openings under Turkey's initiative," Erdogan said. He added that Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Gul was to visit the breakaway Turkish state in 
the north of Cyprus on Thursday to "launch the new steps" ahead of 
the planned Belgrade meeting. han/fc/gil Cyprus-Turkey-Greece

Sweden has reported its first probable case of a deadly respiratory 
virus, the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control said on 
Tuesday. "We now have a probable case" of Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS), Hans Blystad, senior medical epidimiologist at SMI 
told AFP. A man is being treated in isolation at a non-disclosed hospital 
in Sweden after recently returning home from Beijing, is the first 
Swedish case to be reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
Blystad said. "We are awaiting the results of a chest x-ray, which 
could take two to three days," Blystad said. Seven earlier suspected 
cases of SARS in Sweden have all been dismissed, Blystad said. Suspected 
cases involve anyone with a fever and cough who has recently visited 
SARS-afflicted areas; probable cases carry a higher degree of likelihood 
and must be reported to WHO, Blystad said. The mystery virus erupted 
in southern China's Guangdong province in November and has spread 
worldwide, mostly by airline passengers, killing more than 60 people. 
It manifests itself as a form of pneumonia and is spread through direct 
close contact with an infected person. The Swedish foreign ministry 
and institute last week advised against travel to SARS-afflicted areas.

Malaysia's health authorities Tuesday announced the country's first 
suspected cases of the deadly pneumonia virus that has sparked a global 
health scare, the official Bernama news agency reported. Health ministry 
director general Mohamad Taha Arif was quoted as saying that eight 
people with symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) had 
been admitted to hospital for tests. A 37-year-old woman was in hospital 
in southern Johor state neighbouring Singapore, which has been hard 
hit by the illness, while the other seven cases were reported in Kuala 
Lumpur, he said. The mysterious respiratory illness which first erupted 
in southern China and has been transported to North America and Europe 
by travellers has killed more than 60 people worldwide. jsm/lb/cl

Italian police said Tuesday they had arrested four men in northern 
Italy suspected of links to an Islamic extremist organisation. A police 
spokesman declined to give details of the arrests, but newspapers 
reported that four men of Middle Eastern origin had been arrested 
overnight on suspicion of links to the Iraq-based Ansar al-Islam. 
The men were reported to be under police surveillance for around a 
year and preparing to leave Italy when they were arrested. Police 
in Milan said they would release more details later on Tuesday. clr/db/yad

Italy on Tuesday renewed its attack on plans by four European Union 
countries including France and Germany to hold a special defence summit, 
saying it should be open to all 15 EU members. Foreign Minister Franco 
Frattini said he would formally ask the Greek presidency of the European 
Union on Tuesday to enlarge the mini-summit to include all 15 member 
states. "The idea of a summit at the end of April is a good thing, 
among the 15, many of whom have the same ideas about these issues. 
But it must be something for all 15," Frattini told the daily La Repubblica 
in an interview. "The European Council meeting on March 20, the documents 
of the Convention are all of the same mind about strengthening European 
defence," he said. Italy is among several EU member states to criticise 
the summit, set to include Germany, France, Belgium and Luxembourg. 
The April 29 summit has revived talk of a "two-tiered" EU at a time 
when the continent is badly fractured over Iraq. If no one else attends, 
the summit will gather EU's strongest opponents of the US-led war 
on Iraq and omit backers of the US-led campaign to oust Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein -- Britain, Denmark, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.

The office of the Iraqi president denied Tuesday reports from the 
Pentagon that members of Saddam Hussein's family were trying to flee 
the country. "The small family of our leader Saddam Hussein is part 
of the extended family that is the Iraqi people and as Saddam Hussein 
has tied his fate to the fate of his people ... the fate of his family 
cannot be separated from that of the extended family," a spokesman 
for the president's office said, quoted by state television. He said 
Saddam's family and the Iraqi people "have a common destiny -- to 
be rewarded with a decisive victory" in the war against the United 
States and Britain. The denial came after US Defence Department spokeswoman 
Victoria Clarke said: "We have seen evidence that family members are 
fleeing the country, or trying to flee the country." The Iraqi statement 
declared this a "fabrication," adding: "We realise the great people 
of Iraq know how leader Saddam Hussein thinks and behaves." Clarke 
said US intelligence had seen "neither hide nor hair" of Saddam or 
his two sons since bombing raids on his compound on the first day 
of the war on March 20. They have however appeared on Iraqi state 
television and ministers have denied reports they have been killed 
or wounded. ezz/bp/kir Iraq-war-Saddam-family

The owners of a Lithuanian hotel have called in the police after accusing 
Scottish fans in the country for a Euro 2004 qualifier of vandalising 
a hotel room, police said Tuesday. Police said the manager of the 
hotel Viktorija accused two fans of breaking the furniture and window 
frames in one of the hotel rooms and throwing a television set out 
of the window. The two fans denied the charges saying they were drinking 
at the hotel bar and did not know who was responsible. Some 44 Scottish 
fans have booked rooms in the hotel through to April 5. The Scots 
travelled to Kaunas in Lithuania on Wednesday as surprise leaders 
of Euro 2004 Group Five after Lithuania's surprise 1-1 draw with World 
Cup runners-up Germany in Nuremberg. It was estimated that in total 
some 3,000 Scottish football fans are to come to Lithuania to support 
their team. rac/jmy/ak Fbl-Eur2004-LIT-SCO-fans

Military chiefs from the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS) are due to meet in Dakar on a peacekeeping force for Ivory 
Coast, crippled by a seven-month rebel war, officials said Tuesday. 
Some 1,100 soldiers from ECOWAS member states have already been deployed 
in Ivory Coast, with the regional peacekeeping force due to number 
around 1,200 troops. The talks initially planned for Tuesday "will 
finally take place on Wednesday" in the Senegalese capital, a Senegalese 
military official said. The west African force is made up of soldiers 
from Niger, Senegal, Benin, Ghana and Togo and is eventually due to 
take over peacekeeping duties from French troops, who have been deployed 
in Ivory Coast since last October to monitor a ceasefire. A rebellion 
by disgruntled soldiers in Ivory Coast on September 19 last year quickly 
developed into a low-level war that has divided the country in two, 
geographically and ideologically. ECOWAS is made up of Benin, Burkina 
Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, 
Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. omj/kdz/nb

CENTRAL IRAQ, April 1 (AFP) - US forces pushing toward Baghdad are 
"very sorry" that they killed seven Iraqi civilian women and children 
whose vehicle failed to halt at a checkpoint in central Iraq, a field 
commander told AFP Tuesday. "We're very concerned about it and very 
sorry that it happened," Major General Buford Blount, commander of 
the Third Infantry Division, said. But he stressed that, with US soldiers 
on edge after a suicide car bomb attack Saturday that killed four 
comrades, the unit that opened fire on the minibus had respected their 
rules of engagement. His words echoed an official statement issued 
by US Central Command, which in part read: "In light of recent terrorist 
attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint 
to avoid the unnecessary loss of life." The shooting occurred Monday 
at a checkpoint near Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad. 
The seven victims were in a vehicle peppered with shots by soldiers 
from Blount's division. US military officials in Qatar said the vehicle 
had not stopped at the checkpoint despite the US troops reportedly 
firing warning shots. Two other people in the vehicle were wounded, 
while four escaped unharmed. Blount was at a loss to say why the vehicle 
did not heed instructions to stop before the checkpoint, and speculated 
that maybe they "were trying to escape from Karbala and thought this 
was a regime checkpoint." He said he had heard that Iraqi death squads 
had taken over homes in Karbala, which lies north of Najaf, and were 
forcing families living near a hospital to leave. He also said that 
his forces had in one encounter seen Iraqi fighters herding women 
and children ahead of them as human shields. In that incident, one 
woman who broke away was shot in the back by the Iraqis and US troops 
put up a smokescreen to rescue her and fly her out for medical treatment. 
The general added that his men had experienced "lots of contact" in 
the region and believed that Iraqi militias loyal to Iraqi Saddam 
Hussein were moving their fighters around using buses. Because of 
that hostile situation, the soldiers who killed the civilians Monday 
had merely been enforcing security measures, he said. "The bus committed 
a hostile act. It may have been unintentional," he said. Orders were 
now going out to try to limit repeats of such incidents, particularly 
by way of putting up more barriers before the checkpoints to force 
drivers to a complete halt well before the troop positions, he said. 
Civilians would also be encouraged to stay at home and not move around, 
he said. lc/rmb/kir Iraq-war-US-checkpoint-general

China will bring in veteran coach Jiang Xingquan to lead the men's 
national basketball team following dismal performances last year at 
the World Championships and the Asian Games, press reports said Tuesday. 
Jiang, who coached China to its highest-ever eighth place finish at 
the 1994 World Championships, was expected to be named soon to head 
the national team at this September's Asian Men's Championships in 
Harbin, China, the Beijing Evening News reported. The 62-year old 
Jiang last year helped the Xinjiang Guanghui Club advance from China's 
B league to a surprising fourth place finish in the just completed 
top division regular season. He will replace Wang Fei, who coached 
China to a disappointing 12th place finish at last summer's World 
Championships in Indianapolis and a second place finish to South Korea 
at the Asian Games in September. China, which has traditionally dominated 
Asian basketball, needs to win the Asian Championships if it hopes 
to receive an automatic berth to the 2004 Olympic Games. NBA standout 
Yao Ming, who plays for the Houston Rockets, is expected to join up 
with the national team for the Asian Championships as will San Antonio 
backup center Menk Bateer. sai/cl/ak Basket-CHN

A Russian doctor known here for his work in war zones said Tuesday 
he would travel to Geneva and New York in an effort to organize a 
"green corridor" to evacuate dozens of Iraqi children injured during 
the US-led war against Iraq. "We are not asking for anything permanent. 
All we ask for is that the Americans agree that they do not bomb certain 
roads for a certain stretch of time," Leonid Roshal told reporters. 
He said he mentioned the plan to President Vladimir Putin and that 
the Russian leader agreed with the idea. "I myself asked Putin about 
this and he said that he supported it," Roshal told reporters. "Who 
would not want to help children?" Roshal said that he was still waiting 
for a formal response from Washington and that the Iraqi ambassador 
to Russia approved of the plan. He said that the International Committee 
of the Red Cross -- which would have to play a key role in any such 
evacuation -- has been hesitant. "The Red Cross was very cautious 
and told me it may be too early to review this question," Roshal said 
without going into further details. Roshal has worked in many war 
zones of the former Soviet Union and most recently assisted both civilians 
and Chechen guerrillas involved in October's three-day Moscow theater 
hostage standoff in which at least 129 civilians died. He was awarded 
with a medal for his efforts by Putin earlier this year. zak/hm/yad

A senior Palestinian minister on Tuesday accused Israel of stalling 
an internationally drafted peace plan after Foreign Minister Silvan 
Shalom said in Washington the Palestinians had first to fight "terrorism." 
Shalom stressed after a meeting with US President George W. Bush that 
"there cannot be two parallel paths: the war against terrorism in 
the day and negotiations at night. "The end of terrorism constitutes 
the central question for a return to negotiations with the Palestinians," 
he told Israeli radio. He was reiterating the constant argument by 
Israeli Minister Ariel Sharon that the Jewish state will not "negotiate 
under fire." Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat slammed Shalom's remarks. 
"The statement by Shalom in the White House is an Israeli rejection 
of the roadmap," he said, referring to the peace plan based on a Bush 
speech last June, and drawn up in collaboration with European Union, 
Russian and United Nations diplomats. "Israel is working to thwart 
any efforts to try to bring the peace process back on track. Shalom 
is challenging the White House and creating the basis for a continuing 
rejection of the roadmap," he said. "Israel talks in English of peace 
but gives orders in Hebrew to attack," he said. Erakat also had tough 
words on a US State Department report on human rights, which accused 
the Palestinians of serious rights violations while saying the Israelis 
had some problems with their large Arab minority. "There is no talk 
of the highest kind of terrorism, which is occupation, controlling 
people under the threat of weapons. What we are facing under Israeli 
occupation after 35 years is the highest kind of terrorism and violation 
of human rights. The reports doesn't mention these things," he said. 
The State Department's annual rights report said members of the Palestinian 
security forces and Arafat's Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) took part in anti-Israel violence and terrorist 
attacks. It said that while there was no proof of official approval 
of such acts, some endorsed the use of violence in principle in a 
violation of commitments to halt attacks on Israelis. sa-jh/kir Mideast-Palestinian-US-Israel

Hong Kong businesses keep going in face of deadly virus by Peter Lim 
= (PICTURES) = ATTENTION - UPDATES Hong Kong toll /// HONG KONG, April 
1 (AFP) - Hong Kong's business is business and companies are doing 
all they can to keep the corporate wheels turning despite a deadly 
virus outbreak, including having staff work from home and opening 
back-up offices away from infected sites. Hong Kong is the centre 
of the global outbreak severe acute respiratory sydndrome (SARS), 
which has now infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed 
more than 60. After breaking out in neighbouring Guangdong province 
in southern China, the virus spread to Hong Kong, where 16 people 
have died and at least 685 have been infected. In most offices business 
is continuing as usual, despite the wide adoption of surgical masks, 
which make many workplaces look more like hospital wards. But some 
firms have had to adopt innovative measures to ensure their staff 
and businesses remain healthy. Global banking giant HSBC has told 
50 of its staff in its capital markets and treasury department to 
work from home for a week, while another worksite is prepared for 
them. An HSBC teller was diagnosed with SARS last week. Vinh Tram, 
spokeswoman for HSBC Holdings plc, said the priority was to ensure 
operations could continue without interruption. "We have contingency 
plans in case of emergency, including creating a backup team," she 
said. Other firms have also had to arrange for staff to work from 
home after one of their workers has been found to be suffering from 
the virus. Dao Heng Bank, owned by Singapore-based DBS Group Holdings, 
said a staff member based in its customer centre has been diagnosed 
with SARS. Medical check-ups have been arranged for all staff members 
who may have been in contact with the employee and they have been 
told to stay at home in the meantime, spokeswoman Angel Lin said. 
"We have a back-up team to ensure minimal disruption to operations," 
said Lin. In common with many other companies, Dao Heng's parent DBS 
Group has suspended all business travel for its employees to minimise 
exposure to SARS. For many businesses, a downturn is inevitable as 
a result of the outbreak. Many shops and restaurants are suffering 
a slump as many people try to avoid public places as much as possible. 
The Grand Hyatt Hotel in has decided to suspend all buffet meal operations 
at its restaurants. "The well-being of our guests and employees is 
always of paramount concern," hotel spokeswoman Vivian Wan said. A 
sudden eruption of cases at the Amoy Gardens estate in Kowloon district 
prompted the Hong Kong authorities to take the unprecedented measure 
of ordering the complete isolation of the housing block on Monday. 
A total of around 200 cases have been uncovered at Amoy Gardens, and 
several local businesses have also had to close. As a precautionary 
measures, Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. has decided to close down 
a branch in the Amoy Gardens complex. "This is just a precautionary 
measure," said spokeswoman Angel Yip. "We have emergency measures 
in different departments in case any staff fall ill to the disease, 
in order to keep business going on," said Yip. Irene Chan, spokeswoman 
for Walt Disney's Hong Kong operations, said some staff have been 
allowed to take leave to look after their children after local schools 
were closed to contain the spread of the virus. There have been reports 
that some expatriate workers have sent their families home but Chan 
said Disney's foreign staff continued to report to work. "At the moment, 
no expatriate staff have asked to return home," said Chan. pl/bro

The United Nations children's relief agency UNICEF warned Tuesday 
that time is running out for Iraqi children as the US-led war against 
President Saddam Hussein drags on. "In this war, time is working against 
the children. Without massive help in bringing in water, medical and 
food supplies, many children and pregnant women will not survive this 
conflict," said UNICEF Iraq operations head Carel de Rooy. De Rooy 
said the main problem was getting water to civilians in places where 
there was heavy fighting, like the southern city of Basra where he 
said more than 1.2 million people had been without drinking water 
for more than a week. He said that 100,000 children under the age 
of five were in severe danger of falling ill, and that drinking dirty 
water has been the top killer of children in Iraq over the last year. 
UNICEF also warned that as many as 500,000 Iraqi children could be 
in need of psychological help as a result of trauma suffered during 
the war. loc/km/yad Iraq-war-UNICEF-Germany

Nigeria's main labour movement said Tuesday that two weeks before 
the start of key national elections it had reached an agreement with 
government to halt a threatened public sector pay strike. A three-day 
warning strike was to have begun on Tuesday, but an overnight meeting 
with government officials led to its suspension until after polling 
day, labour and government officials said. Nigeria has been gripped 
by fuel shortages and a rising tide of ethnic and political violence 
in the run up to the elections, and the Nigeria Labour Congress's 
(NLC) decision will come as a relief to government. The news will 
also be welcomed on the world oil markets, which are already nervously 
eyeing ethnic unrest in the south of the country which has seen Nigeria's 
crude exports slashed by 40 percent. "We held a fruitful meeting with 
President Olusegun Obasanjo ... and the labour minister, and we agreed 
to suspend the strike pending the resolution of the dispute," NLC 
spokesman Owei Lakemfa told AFP. "The government has agreed to set 
up an implementation committee on the issue of the 12.5 percent pay 
rise for workers. We believe they will honour the agreement this time," 
he added. The deal would directly effect Nigeria's legions of federal 
government workers, including those in state oil production, telecoms 
and power firms, but will serve as a benchmark for state governments 
and the private sector. A statement released by the presidency signed 
by President Olusegun Obasanjo and NLC president Adams Oshiomhole 
confirmed that an interim agreement had been reached. "At the instance 
of the federal government, the leadership of the NLC met leadership 
of the federal government to deliberate on the issue of a 12.5 percent 
salary increase for workers," it said. "It was agreed that both sides 
shall work out the modalities for implementing the salary increase 
as it affects all grade levels. A joint committee to work out this 
has already been set up," it said. It said a suplementary budget on 
the pay hike will be sent to parliament for approval, and called on 
workers to show patience. On March 12, the NLC had threatened to call 
an indefinite national strike from April 1 because of the government's 
failure to honour a pay agreement, but by Sunday it was scaling back 
its threat. "We have limited the strike to three days in order to 
ensure that the forthcoming elections are conducted peacefully," Oshiomhole 
told reporters. Lakemfa said Tuesday that the impending poll had influenced 
the union's decision. "We do not want to heat up the system ahead 
of the general and presidential polls in April," he said. "There are 
lots of bad things going on such as political assassinations, long 
queues for petrol, that it will be unreasonable to add to the sufferings 
of the masses." Nigeria is to hold legislative, governorship and presidential 
elections this month, in the first test of the troubled west African 
nation's experiment with democracy since the 1999 return of civilian 
rule. A series of assassinations, riots and protests has raised fears 
that -- in a country which has seen more than 10,000 people killed 
in less than four years -- the polls could be marred by violence. 
In the Niger Delta region of the south of the country, a violent uprising 
by ethnic Ijaw militants has forced oil multinationals to evacuate 
facilities producing more than 800,000 barrels per day, more than 
a third of normal output. In May 2000, the government pledged a 25 
percent pay rise would be awarded to workers in January 2002, but 
in harder than expected economic times the agreement was never implemented. 
A joint committee of government officials and labour reduced the increase 
to 12.5 percent in 2002, but the government still failed to come up 
eith the cash. The NLC has embarked on strikes in the past to press 
demand for pay increases and improved welfare for workers in the country.

President Saddam Hussein has decided to decorate soldiers who have 
put up stiff resistance against US and British troops in the south 
of the country, Iraqi satellite television said Tuesday. Two medals 
-- the Decoration of Umm al-Maarek or the Mother of All Battles, as 
Baghdad calls the 1991 Gulf War, and the Wisam al-Rafidain, or Order 
of the Two Rivers -- would be awarded to the entire 45th Brigade, 
which defended the port city of Umm Qasr, according to a presidential 
decree read on air. Umm Qasr, Iraq's only deep-water seaport on its 
short Gulf coastline, lies on the western side of the Fao Peninsula 
460 kilometres (280 miles) south of Baghdad. Few had expected a scrap 
over the small port city, but it took crack British and US forces 
six days to quell Iraqi resistance. Baghdad still denies it has fallen. 
The 45th Brigade's soldiers would also receive medals for bravery, 
it said, adding that special decorations would be awarded posthumously 
to those killed in the fighting. Medals for bravery would also be 
awarded to fighters confronting coalition troops in Nasiriyah, some 
350 kilometres (220 miles) south of Baghdad, and in the southeastern 
Fao peninsula, which British forces say they have secured. Nasiriyah, 
with its bridges crossing the Euphrates, has been the scene of heavy 
combat between US marines and Iraqi irregulars fighting to interrupt 
the flow of supplies to US forces farther north. The officers commanding 
the Nasiriyah and Fao troops will also receive both the Mother of 
All Battles medal and Order of the Two Rivers, according to the decrees. 
The state INA news agency, meanwhile, reported that Saddam had decided 
to provide families of those who fought at Umm Qasr and Nasiriyah 
with two million dinars (6,740 dollars) each. Saddam reportedly ordered 
a non-commissioned officer who killed at least four US soldiers in 
a suicide attack Saturday be promoted posthumously to colonel and 
also showered money on his family. ma/dab/kir Iraq-war-Saddam-medals

Indian Kashmir's influential separatist alliance Tuesday urged Hindus 
not to leave the Muslim-dominated Kashmir valley following the massacre 
of 24 Hindus. "We have been disturbed by the reports that the members 
of minority community have decided to leave the valley after the Nadi 
Marg massacre," the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) said in 
a statement. Some 24 Hindus -- 11 men, 11 women and two children -- 
were lined up and sprayed with bullets by unidentified gunmen in the 
village of Nadi Marg on the evening of March 23. Kashmiri Hindus, 
also called Pandits, have demanded they be moved to the Hindu-dominated 
Jammu region of Kashmir or other parts of India. More than 200,000 
Hindus have left Kashmir since 1989 when an anti-Indian Muslim rebellion 
broke out. Fighting has claimed nearly 38,000 lives since then. Some 
10,000 Hindus have stayed behind, but many now want to leave. "The 
Hurriyat, on behalf of the Muslims of Kashmir, makes a passionate 
appeal to oru Kashmiri Pandit brothers to reconsider their decision 
(to leave)," a statement said. "The Hurriyat want the lives and properties 
of all residents of Kashmir to be secure. But that is only possible 
when an impartial enquiry is held into the gruesome massacres of the 
members of the minority communities in Kashmir, to expose the ruthless 
killers once for all." Many Kashmiri Hindu leaders have asked Kashmiri 
separatists to guarantee their safety. "The Hurriyat understands that 
providing security is the jurisdiction of the government," the statement 
said. The Nadi Marg massacre was the worst in Kashmir involving Hindus. 
On March 20, 2000 some 37 Sikhs were killed in the south Kashmir village 
of Chattisinghpora on the eve of then-US President Bill Clinton's 
visit to India. str/an/sdm India-Kashmir-Hindus

The death toll from a powerful gas explosion in a Chinese coal mine 
had risen to 25 Tuesday, while one survivor had been found after being 
buried alive for more than a day, officials said. A total of 45 people 
were inside the Mengjiagou mine, near Fushun city in northeastern 
Liaoning province, when the blast occurred on Sunday, according to 
the officials. As of late Tuesday, the number of confirmed deaths 
had risen to 25, while there were 20 survivors, an official at the 
State Burau of Supervising Coalmine Safety told AFP. Rescue workers 
late Monday found one coal miner who had been trapped in the mine 
for more than 24 hours. He is now hospitalized and out of danger, 
according to a local official. Chinese mines have an appalling safety 
record, and the number of mining deaths last year reached 14,924, 
according to the State Administration of Work Safety. ph/sai/sdm China-mine

The recent outbreak of a killer respiratory illness and the war in 
Iraq have had no immediate impact on the ratings and outlook of Taiwan's 
biggest air carrier China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan Ratings Corp. said 
Tuesday. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) would have a stronger 
impact than the Iraq war on the carrier, with China and Hong Kong 
the two worst hit areas, the agency, a partner of Standard and Poor's, 
said in a statement. Demand for air travel would decline and China 
Airlines' overall performance was likely to weaken in the near term. 
But the carrier's current credit protection measures are in line with 
its rating, Taiwan Ratings said. The agency will review China Airlines' 
rating and outlook if the impact of SARS and the Iraq war becomes 
more severe than expected and affects the company's load factors, 
it added. bur/cty/dv Health-pneumonia-Taiwan-air-CAL-company

Tunisia wants a special status with the European Union putting the 
north African country at "an intermediary stage between an associate 
and member", officials reported Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi 
as having said Tuesday. Ghannouchi made his statement at a working 
session with European Commission President Romano Prodi, who arrived 
Monday in Tunisia for a two-day visit, the officials said. The special 
status that Tunisia hopes to achieve is in line with the EU's Euro-Mediterranean 
partnership, Ghannouchi said. "We want a more solid, diverse and fruitful 
partnership (with the EU) to create a solidarity that can stand up 
to any test in any domain," he said. Ghannouchi recalled that Tunisia, 
which derives most of its foreign exchange revenues from tourism, 
had been hard hit by the aftershock of the September 11, 2001 attacks 
in the United States. The situation had worsened with the global economic 
slowdown and because of the war in Iraq. Because of the negative outlook, 
Tunisia "needs firmer backing from the European Union, which is Tunisia's 
main trading partner, with a view to promoting its integration in 
the Euro-Mediterannean group," Ghannouchi said. Prodi, meanwhile, 
restated the EU's commitment to stronger ties with Tunisia and to 
helping the north African country to modernise its economy "in spite 
of the current climate, which will be very difficult for all the world's 
countries." Tunisia and the EU signed a partnership agreement in 1995, 
which came into effect in 1998. The accord was the first to be signed 
between the EU and a non-European, Mediterranean country. Prodi was 
on Monday awarded an honorary doctorate at the University of Tunis, 
in honour of his career as an "academic, researcher and politician, 
and of his contribution to European construction and the rapprochement 
between the people on the two banks of the Mediterranean." Prodi is 
due to return to Brussels on Tuesday afternoon. pvr/kdz/nb Tunisia-EU-Prodi

Hong Kong's government is under fire for its handling of the pneumonia 
crisis, with some critics saying fear of offending the Chinese government 
has hampered efforts to contain the health scare. Democratic Party 
legislator Li Wah-ming said despite the closing of schools and the 
isolation of a 33-storey residential complex in the territory, efforts 
to contain the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 
had been "too little, too late." "I would say they overlooked the 
importance of this issue and that may be because of political reasons 
concerning the mainland," he said. "Unfortunately the Chinese government 
has handled this issue with denial and Hong Kong has been more concerned 
about offending China than it has been in pushing the mainland to 
get the information needed to stop this disease." Neighboring China 
has been the country worst hit by the mysterious SARS virus, with 
at least 34 dying from the disease from an estimated 800 infections 
since it first appeared there in November. But the Chinese authorities 
have been strongly criticised around the world for failing to reveal 
the extent of the outbreak and for preventing World Health Organisation 
(WHO) officials from visiting affected areas in Guangdong province 
across the border from Hong Kong. SARS is believed to have been brought 
to Hong Kong from Guangdong in early March by a doctor who later succumbed 
to the disease. It has now spread to at least another 15 countries, 
infecting some 1,700 people and and killing at least 62. The death 
toll in Hong Kong rose to 15 Monday with another 610 people believed 
infected, prompting authorities to order a 264-unit block of a housing 
complex isolated until midnight April 9. The measure was taken after 
185 residents in the block came down with the flu-like symptoms of 
SARS, including 64 who were diagnosed on Monday. But a health department 
spokeswoman told AFP Tuesday there were only some 240 residents in 
108 units when the quarantine order was put in place, and that authorities 
had little information on the whereabouts of tenants from another 
156 units who have reportedly fled. Li Wah-ming said the number of 
missing tenants meant the quarantining effort would likely fail, adding 
that more assertive action should have been taken much earlier in 
the epidemic. "The authorities have reacted very slowly. They've given 
the impression they are doing what is needed, but clearly that has 
not been the case," he said. Democratic Party colleague Martin Lee 
said he was loathe to criticise the government during "such a serious 
crisis," but he said the government should probably have taken tougher 
action much earlier. "Some people certainly believe we have lost a 
lot of precious time, and certainly doctors are saying we should have 
acted very much faster," he said. "If we look at the situation in 
Singapore, for example, they have been very efficient." Singapore 
on Tuesday quarantined the country's men's and women's rugby teams 
on their return from the Hong Kong Sevens tournament as part of a 
series of tough measures aimed at containing SARS. Singapore has also 
put more than 800 households under mandatory home quarantine for 10 
days and placed 600,000 school children on forced vacation until April 
6 in response to just four SARS related deaths and 92 suspected infections.

Danish international midfielder Stig Tofting faces a four month jail 
term after deciding not to appeal against his conviction for assault, 
it was reported here Tuesday. The 33-year-old World Cup player was 
convicted of assaulting a Copenhagen cafe manager during a night out 
with fellow internationals following the squad's return from the 2002 
World Cup where they lost 3-0 to England in a second round match. 
But Danish TV2 television, quoting Tofting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, 
said on its website he would face the consequences of his conviction. 
Tofting's English Premiership club Bolton suspended the player last 
October pending the result of an appeal. His last match was in the 
FA Cup third round replay loss to Sunderland in January, but he is 
still on their books. bur/rw/ak Fbl-DEN-Tofting

Red tape, face saving behind China's pneumonia silence: experts by 
Robert J. Saiget ATTENTION - ADDS quotes from Ministry of Health, 
foreign affairs /// BEIJING, April 1 (AFP) - Red tape, face-saving 
measures and institutional incompetence are most likely behind China's 
refusal to face up to the outbreak of a deadly respiratory disease, 
experts said Tuesday. Under international criticism, China's Center 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) issued its first bulletin 
on atypcial pneumonia since March 26 urging all health departments 
to take effective measures to control the disease that has killed 
at least 62 people worldwide. Doctors were also urged to report to 
their provincial disease control centers any patients showing symptoms 
of atypical pneumonia, guidelines on the CDCP's website said. A team 
of World Health Organization experts was Tuesday also awaiting Beijing's 
permission to travel to southern Guangdong province where they believe 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) first broke out last November. 
China has been the country worst hit by the mysterious virus, which 
has left 34 dead and more than 800 infected. Most SARS figures came 
from a report by Guangdong province that only went up to March 1. 
Fifteen people have died and more than 600 have been infected in neighboring 
Hong Kong after a doctor from Guangdong brought the illness into the 
territory. The WHO experts were reportedly seeking to investigate 
whether or not farm animals in southern China were the source of the 
virus. "China needs to get up to speed with the international effort 
to map the spread of this disease," said Dr. James Maguire, a WHO 
expert currently in Beijing awaiting permission to go to Guangdong. 
"During a global epidemic all players need to participate, if a major 
player chooses not to, this could be very problematic," he told AFP. 
The team of five WHO experts was also waiting for China to fulfill 
its promise of providing daily provincial reports updating the progress 
of the disease nationwide, but so far such reports have not been forthcoming. 
"We are hoping to get updated information, but China has a system 
that is not exactly set up for this type of thing, so changes to the 
system is what is needed, as soon as possible," Maguire said. However, 
the Ministry of Health Tuesday said that a national level report on 
the disease would not be forthcoming because of bureaucratic wrangling 
over what diseases local health departments are required to report. 
"The illness is not on a list of infectious diseases, so there will 
not be any statistics published on the national level," ministry spokeswoman 
Li Jie told AFP. Provincial level health departments were expected 
to issue reports soon, she said without elaborating. Meanwhile, China's 
foreign ministry continued to insist the epidemic was under control, 
despite the WHO's view the disease was still spreading. "So far the 
disease has been under effective control. Most patients have recovered 
and have left hospital," ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters. 
"It has not spread to other places. Besides Guangdong, Beijing and 
Shanxi, we have not found cases in other parts of China." Hu Jia, 
director of the Beijing-based Aizhi Institute, a non-governmental 
AIDS awareness group, cast doubt on the government's statements, citing 
a long-standing policy to keep epidemics out of the public view. "This 
is an institutionalized problem, health officials are just not used 
to reporting because the spread of disease in China has always been 
secretive," Hu told AFP. "I think it is pretty clear, the government 
does not want to see China as the center of transmission of atypical 
pneumonia." The state-run press failed to carry any new updates on 
the spread of the disease on Tuesday, as more international events 
scheduled to be held in China were cancelled. Following the cancelation 
of two Rolling Stones concerts in Shanghai and Beijing and several 
sporting events last week, the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced 
Tuesday it would postpone its annual China Business Summit. bur-sai/ph/pch

Jordanian authorities have foiled two Iraqi plots to attack US interests 
in its western neighbour, including a bid to poison the water supply 
of US troops and an attempted bombing of a luxury hotel, diplomatic 
sources said Tuesday. The first conspiracy was the reason for the 
expulsion of three Iraqi diplomats late last month, while the second 
led to the arrest of four other Iraqis last week, the sources said. 
The bomb plot involved the Hyatt Amman Hotel, where nearly 70 foreign 
journalists are staying. A large contingent of US nationals has also 
taken up residence in two adjacent tower blocks for as yet unexplained 
reasons. "Four Iraqis were arrested in Amman last week for their involvement 
in an attempt to blow up the Hyatt Amman Hotel", one of the sources 
told AFP, asking not to be identified. The four were not diplomats 
and enjoyed no immunity, he added. A fire broke out on the ninth floor 
of the hotel last week, prompting rumours of an attempted bombing. 
But hotel staff questioned by AFP insisted that the blaze, which was 
rapidly brought under control, was the result of an electrical short 
circuit. There was no immediate confirmation that the fire was the 
incident which prompted the four arrests. The poisoning plot involved 
water mains serving Jordanian military bases close to the Iraqi border 
where US troops are based, the diplomatic sources said. "The Iraqi 
diplomats expelled on March 23 were conspiring to poison water mains 
serving the east of Jordan," where most of the US forces deployed 
in the kingdom are based, one of the sources told AFP, declining to 
be identified. Publicly, officials insist there are just a few hundred 
US service personnel here, playing no direct role in the fighting 
in neighbouring Iraq, but diplomatic sources say that in reality the 
number is more like 6,000. The sources did not elaborate on the nature 
of the poison said to have been involved in the plot. Jordan originally 
expelled five embassy staff but later lifted the expulsion order against 
two of them. King Abdullah II also made clear the following day that 
Jordan was ready to allow Iraq to name replacements for those kicked 
out. Jordanian officials have so far refused to spell out the reasons 
for the expulsion orders against the diplomats, saying only that they 
were issued for security reasons.. But last week Foreign Minister 
Marwan Moasher threatened to reveal the details if Iraq persisted 
in accusing Jordan of bending to US pressure. "The issue of the three 
(expelled) Iraqi diplomats is purely a security one and we did not 
choose to divulge details on it in because we are not interested in 
a public debate or an uproar with Iraq," Moasher said. "If the Iraqis 
wish to further provoke this issue and to paint it as an answer to 
an American request, we will divulge these details." Iraqi officials 
have since taken a more conciliatory line, waxing lyrical about the 
strength of ties between the two countries. "Jordanian-Iraqi relations 
are like a stream of friendship and have a deep historical depth to 
them and what happened is nothing but a passing cloud," ambassador 
Sabah Yassin told Jordan's official Petra news agency, adding that 
Baghdad was ready to replace the three expelled diplomats. rh/kir/mb

Australian Cricket Academy coach Bennett King said on Tuesday he was 
surprised and annoyed to hear that he had been appointed the new West 
Indies cricket coach. King said he applied for the position last December 
"just to see what would happen", and had an interview in early March. 
That was the last thing he heard until a phone call early on Tuesday 
from the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) informing him that he had 
been appointed and that the media had been informed. Adelaide-based 
King said he was still considering whether to take up the position 
and had received no formal approach. "They've nominated me as the 
preferred candidate and I haven't agreed to anything," King told Australian 
Associated Press on Tuesday. "I've seen no terms or conditions, I 
still haven't. "I was actually informed at eight o'clock this morning 
of my appointment without really too much prior knowledge that that 
was the way they were going to go. "And then they announced it to 
the press, which I was pretty annoyed at. "At the moment that's where 
it stands and I haven't seen anything, so I can't make any decisions 
really." Asked if he would become the next West Indies coach, replacing 
Roger Harper, King replied: "I'll tell you when they get some terms 
on the table." The Australian team left for the West Indies late Monday, 
with the WICB announcing that Gus Logie would coach the team against 
Australia and Sri Lanka in the interim. King thought he was expected 
in the Caribbean in July. "I believe the first week in July they're 
looking at me being there, but in terms of making a decision, I can't 
do anything until they give me something." When asked if the premature 
announcement of his appointment would effect his decision, King said: 
"We'll wait and see. I need a bit more time to think about it all." 
He added the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) had supported him throughout. 
"I need to speak with the ACB about all this, they've been very supportive 
through this whole process," he said. "Whether it's the right time 
for me, that's something I've got to discuss with my family and also 
the ACB. "I'll certainly be making sure the decision is the correct 
one." rsm/cl/ak Cricket-AUS-WIS-coach

Japan retracted an announcement by its defence agency that it had 
confirmed a new test firing by North Korea of an anti-ship missile 
into the Yellow Sea on Tuesday. Japan's naval chief of staff Koichi 
Furusho told reporters earlier in the day Japan had confirmed that 
a North Korean missile had been test-fired, but after a blunt denial 
by South Korea of any missile launch, officials backtracked, saying 
they were still trying to confirm reports of a launch. Shoei Yamanaka, 
chief of the defence agency's secretariat, "corrected the remark," 
according to an agency spokesman. "It was not right to say we had 
confirmed missile firing as a fact, but what is right is that we have 
obtained information suggesting a missile firing," Yamanaka was quoted 
as saying. "We are still checking details, including whether a missile 
was actually fired or not," the spokesman said. He refused to disclose 
the source of the apparently erroneous information, but said it had 
not come from one of Japan's new spy satellites. Shortly after the 
Japanese announcement of a missile firing, South Korea's defense ministry 
issued a forceful denial, saying no evidence of a missile launch existed 
after consultations with Washington. "Based on the result of South 
Korean and US military intelligence authorities' investigation, we 
confirm again there was no missile launch from North Korea today," 
a spokesman said as military analysts in Seoul suggested that the 
test-firing of an artillery piece could have been confused with a 
missile launch. The news on the missile firing broke after Land, Infrastructure 
and Transport minister Chikage Ogi announced the missile launch at 
the end of a parliamentary committee session. "I just received a preliminary 
report that North Korea seems to have fired a surface-to-vessel missile 
at 10:15 am, that the launch site was Hwajinri in Pyongannamdo (province) 
on the opposite side (of the Korean Peninsula) from the previous launch 
site and that its range was 60 kilometres (38 miles) like the previous 
time," a ministry spokesman quoted Ogi as saying. Speculation has 
been rife in the Japanese media that North Korea would test-fire another 
missile around the time of Japan's placing into orbit last Friday 
of its first spy satellites, a move denounced by Pyongyang as a "hostile 
act" that could spark a new arms race. North Korea test-fired short-range 
anti-ship missiles on February 24 and March 10, sparking fears especially 
in Japan that the Stalinist nation was preparing to test a ballistic 
missile. In 1998 Pyongyang test-fired a medium-range Taepodong ballistic 
missile that overflew the country and splashed down in the Pacific. 
North Korea is believed to have deployed some 100 Rodong-1 missiles 
with a range of 1,300 kilometres (805 miles), capable of striking 
any target in Japan. Analysts have said the series of short-range 
missile tests was part of Pyongyang's game of brinkmanship aimed at 
breaking US resolve during the tense stand-off over the North's nuclear 
weapons drive. bur-mis-ja/rcw NKorea-nuclear-missile-Japan

The dollar showed signs of stabilising on Tuesday after suffering 
heavy recent losses, with some dealers taking the view that recent 
pessimism over progress by coalition forces in Iraq might have been 
overdone. The single European currency dipped to 1.0896 dollars from 
1.0933 late on Monday in New York. The dollar rose to 118.04 yen from 
117.95 on Monday. Michael Klawitter, economist at the German bank 
WestLB, said that the steadier tone of the dollar was not surprising 
given the "very substantial sell-off" of the US currency in recent 
days. "We're pretty much back at the levels where we were before all 
this euphoria about a swift military success" by coalition forces 
in Iraq developed, he added. With little fresh market-moving news 
from the Gulf, the dollar could enjoy a brief period of respite, Klawitter 
said. "Generally there is broad consensus that the US dollar will 
weaken further over the next one month or three months. In the short 
term, however, there is a perception now that all the pessimism on 
the developments in the war against Iraq probably is slightly overdone," 
he said. But other analysts said that any new headline or economic 
data from the United States could send the US unit limping lower again. 
"Attention is largely centralised on the war in Iraq and the prospects 
for a longer conflict," said Audrey Childe-Freeman, economist at Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce. "Any news appears to be bad news for the 
dollar," she added. With the dollar still the whipping boy of the 
market, dealers largely overlooked some gloomy data from the euro-zone 
and Japan. The euro zone purchasing managers' index fell by more than 
expected to 48.4 in March from 50.1 in February, pointing to an increased 
risk of recession in the manufacturing sector, economists said. "The 
recessionary risk in the euro zone is quite substantial but again 
it is nothing that in the short term affects the currency market given 
that it remains driven by dollar sentiment," said Klawitter. The Bank 
of Japan's Tankan survey meanwhile showed business confidence among 
large manufacturers declined to minus 10 in the three months to March 
from minus nine in the previous quarter. Sentiment among large non-manufacturers 
improved slightly to minus 14 from minus 16. "Investors did not take 
the Tankan results as a lead in the market. They were more concerned 
about the possibility of a long war in Iraq and its impact on the 
US economy," said Masato Imai, dealer at UFJ Holdings in Tokyo. The 
euro was changing hands at 1.0896 dollars from 1.0924 late on Monday 
in New York, 129.00 yen (128.82), 0.6894 pounds (0.6898) and 1.4762 
Swiss francs (1.4743). The dollar was being quoted at 118.04 yen (117.95) 
and 1.3545 Swiss francs (1.3492). The pound was at 1.5811 dollars 
(1.5830), 187.00 yen (186.71) and 2.1413 Swiss francs (2.1358). On 
the London Bullion Market, the price of an ounce of gold rose to 335.88 
dollars from 334.85 on Monday afternoon. dr/hd Forex-Europe

China insisted Tuesday it has controlled the spread of a deadly pneumonia 
in the country, and defended itself against growing international 
criticism that its slow actions led to a global outbreak. "The Chinese 
government has all along adopted a very responsible attitude on this 
issue," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said, adding that 
the government has recently released information about cases in China. 
"We know the situation we're in is a safe one." He suggested that 
the international community may be overreacting to the outbreak of 
the atypical pneumonia, known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
(SARS), which has killed more than 60 people and infected around 1,600 
worldwide. "We should follow scientific principles," Liu said. "We 
have nothing to hide. The Chinese government will continue to release 
relevant data and information." Liu said no cases had been discovered 
in parts of China other than southern Guangdong province, Beijing 
and northern Shanxi province. "So far the disease has been under effective 
control. Most patients have recovered and have left hospital," Liu 
told reporters at a regular briefing. "It has not been spread to other 
places. Besides Guangdong, Beijing and Shanxi, we have not found cases 
in other parts of China." China has been the country worst hit by 
the mysterious virus, which has left 34 dead in the country and more 
than 800 infected in Guangdong, Shanxi and Beijing. Liu, however, 
said more updated figures would soon be released. He did not explain 
what the new data would show. But he insisted that China was a safe 
place to visit despite cancellations of various events, including 
the first ever concerts in China of the Rolling Stones, and travel 
warnings by the US government. "Regardless of whether it's Chinese 
citizens living in China or foreigners paying business or other trips 
to China, they will be safe," Liu said. International health experts 
suspect the pneumonia originated in China, which has come under fire 
for providing little information about the epidemic, which expedited 
its spread. cs/sai/th Health-pneumonia-China-control

The Israeli army on Tuesday destroyed the West Bank house of a suicide 
bomber who injured 26 people and another militant allegedly linked 
to jailed Fatah deputy Marwan Barghuti, officials said. The army demolished 
the house near Tulkarem of Rami Ghanen, 20, a first-year student from 
Al-Quds university in the northern town, who on Sunday blew himself 
apart in the seaside resort of Netanya, an army spokesman said. "The 
destruction of terrorists houses constitutes a message to the terrorists 
and their accomplices that all those involved will pay for their acts," 
said the army spokesman. The army also destroyed the house of Nasser 
Abu Hmeid, jailed by Israel on charges of attacks in the name of the 
Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an armed offshoot of Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. Israel accuses him of being a lieutenant 
of Barghuti, the Fatah's West Bank leader who is facing charges of 
terrorism and heading the Al-Aqsa group. His house was in the Al-Amari 
refugee camp in Ramallah, just north of Jerusalem. Another 30 Palestinians 
wanted by Israel were arrested overnight in sweeps of the West Bank, 
reoccupied by the army since a spate of suicide bombings last June, 
officials said. The army has destroyed some 200 houses belonging to 
militants in a bid to discourage further attacks. Rights groups have 
attacked the policy for also punishing the bombers' families who are 
often left destitute after losing their homes. jlr/jh/dab Mideast-house-demolish

lies ahead, officers said Tuesday. Flight Lieutenant Peter Darling 
said British troops were "nibbling at the edges" of Iraqi defences 
in the city of more than one million people which is seen as a vital 
staging post for humanitarian supplies. The British attacked outlying 
areas of Basra on Monday but were awaiting reinforcements before any 
drive into the town centre, which has been defended by paramilitary 
forces fiercely loyal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. "We're basically 
taking out small chunks of the city. We're not going to be rushed 
into there and liberate it in what one would consider to be an onslaught, 
as it were," he said at the US-led coalition's command centre here. 
"We're going to use our own timetable and do it in our own way. Hopefully 
as the civilians realise that we're here for the long haul, we'll 
get more and more information about where the enemy troops are." In 
the neighbouring town of Abu al-Khasib, 20 kilometres (12 miles) away, 
reports said the last Iraqi resistance had been wiped out and British 
troops were being welcomed by some residents. Darling said the region 
around Basra was generally returning to normal after being "liberated" 
by British forces. "The good news is that in three towns -- Az-Zubayr, 
Rumaila and Safwan -- the soldiers are putting their berets on, which 
shows that there's a large degree of confidence returning to the area," 
Darling said. "Indeed the schools and the markets are reopening." 
Officers here said the berets were a symbolic gesture to the local 
people. "You can see the guys' faces, so it indicates openness and 
friendliness," said one British spokeswoman. Cars, trucks and coaches 
packed with families flooded across the southernmost of four main 
bridges out of the city on Monday, while traders poured in from the 
other direction to sell food and water. One British intelligence source 
told a reporter outside Basra that it was the biggest movement of 
people he had seen in weeks. "There are many reasons for the comings 
and goings ... Some just want to get out of Basra because they can 
-- and they don't want to be around if the British start to get tough 
with the remaining militia," he said. "Others are taking the chance 
to get their wives and children out of the city to be with relatives 
elsewhere and that could account for the fact that it is mainly males 
returning." He said many people indicated that the destruction of 
a huge statue of Saddam in the town centre -- taken out by British 
tanks during a surgical incursion on the weekend -- was the "catalyst 
for some new-found optimism". "This is a sceptical population which 
still has painful memories of the 1991 uprising, when they feel they 
were left to fend for themselves by the Allied forces, before being 
brutally put down by Saddam." That failed uprising was sparked by 
an Iraqi tank commander returning from the Gulf war who took a pot 
shot at the Saddam statue. The intelligence officer, who did not want 
to be named, said the British army excelled at urban operations but 
the Americans might find it much more difficult once they reached 
the outskirts of Baghdad. "With the best will in the world, it's not 
something the Americans do as well as us. They would rather stay inside 
their armoured cars wearing their helmets and body armour rather than 
getting out and about and winning the confidence of these people," 
he said. smc/kir Iraq-war-Basra

The Chechens' votes have been counted, the Kremlin and the pro-Russian 
administration have duly claimed their triumph -- and the people of 
the small village of Alkhan-Kala are looking forward to reaping the 
benefits. Russia is proclaiming the result of the March 23 referendum 
in which, according to official figures, nearly nine electors out 
of 10 approved a new constitution, as the beginning of the end of 
the conflict that has riven this scenic southern republic for most 
of the past decade. The immediate priorities for the villagers of 
Alkhan-Kala, a few kilometres (miles) west of the capital Grozny, 
are running water, a road-bridge and better security. "The authorities 
have promised us compensation for the destruction of the houses, starting 
in April. We want to start rebuilding, but for that we'll need water," 
said Musa Adayev. Alkhan-Kala was particularly badly damaged during 
the first Chechen war of 1994-96, and shortly after the latest conflict 
erupted in October 1999 the water pipes that supplied the village 
were destroyed. Since then local people have had to pay out for water 
brought to them in tanker trucks, a heavy expense for budgets that 
often consist of little more than pensions or unemployment benefits. 
The village's proximity to the capital Grozny has meant that the travails 
of war have been deeply felt here, with frequent sweeps by Russian 
troops and occasional rebel incursions. Even on the eve of the poll, 
separatists fired at the local police station and buildings which 
had been taken over temporarily by federal forces. And yet large numbers 
of villagers turned out to vote in a gesture of hope. If nothing else, 
it might bring nearer the day when the water flowed again. The road-bridge 
also features high on the local wish-list. The old bridge over the 
river Sunzha that divides the village was destroyed in late 2000. 
A light footbridge has temporarily replaced it, but to get across 
the river by car requires a half-hour journey. The former mayor elected 
in mid-2001, Malika Umazheva, had promised a new supply and a new 
road-bridge, but she was shot dead in her home, as her predecessor 
had been, executed as a traitor by rebels who consider all officials 
working with the pro-Russian administration as collaborators. Last 
Sunday, a week after the referendum, Russian troops combed the village 
in an operation reminiscent of the dreaded sweeps of the bad old days. 
But for once they made no arrests, an outcome itself seen as a sign 
of hope. The troops were looking for the killer of a young Russian 
woman whose body had been found in the river by some village children. 
"They must find and punish whoever did this to the woman, especially 
since she had nothing to do with the army," villager Ayub said. "There 
are bandits in our village, like elsewhere, who have no links with 
the resistance and are prepared to kill anyone, Chechen or Russian, 
if it makes them money. They should be shot on the spot," he said, 
voicing the widely held concern over insecurity. Ayub hoped that with 
the referendum out of the way, the pro-Russian authorities would seize 
the opportunity to boost confidence in the republic's future. There 
were new signs of an easing of tensions in Grozny, the local human 
rights centre said in a statement. A roadblock at the end of a bridge 
over the Sunzha has been removed, and the authorities have stepping 
up their announcements of compensation to be made for the damage caused 
to housing, it said. However the compensation process is likely to 
be hampered by the inability of most municipalities to supply lists 
of the residents concerned. aa-via/bb/ds Russia-Chechnya

Swedish pension funds applying ethical criteria in their investment 
are under the proverbial gun after a recent report alleged that a 
number of them invest in companies that produce war materiel. "It's 
false advertising. They label themselves as ethical funds and at the 
same time invest in some of the world's largest war materiel producers," 
charged Rolf Lindahl, a researcher at the non-profit lobby group Swedish 
Peace and Arbitration Society which wrote the report. It cited as 
an example Sweden's leading "ethical funds" manager Banco: this company's 
Ethical Swedish Fund Pension topped the list of 'unethicals' with 
9.3 percent of its holdings in the war industry. Companies such as 
Boeing, BAE Systems, General Dynamics and Raytheon, which manufacture 
many of the fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, missiles and bombs currently 
seeing action in the US-led war against Iraq, are among those found 
on the investment list of many Swedish funds. But, argued Banco, its 
ethical fund was singled out in the report for its holdings in Swedish 
stock market heavyweights Volvo and Ericsson, which are known primarily 
for their trucks and mobile phones -- not their engines and radar 
equipment used in tanks and jet fighters. Banco ethics analyst Tonika 
Hirdman said Banco's definition of "ethical fund" means that more 
than 95 percent of a company's turnover must be derived from industries 
other than the weapons, alcohol or tobacco industries. "One percent 
of Ericsson's sales are, according to our definition, to be classified 
as weapons-related due to their radar equipment" used in jet fighters, 
Hirdman told AFP, saying that was well below the five percent limit 
and rejecting the report as "misleading" and "unscientific". Lindahl 
dismissed Banco's argument. "It doesn't matter if it's only one percent, 
it's one percent of a very large civilian company that has large war 
materiel production," he insisted. The report also found that 26 of 
the 30 most popular premium pension funds -- into which all working-age 
Swedes place the 2.5 percent of income that they can freely invest 
to supplement the state pension -- also had holdings in war materiel 
companies. One of those is the Seventh AP Fund, the state-run default 
fund for Swedes who choose not to place that money themselves which 
manages funds for more than two million Swedes. Six percent of the 
Seventh AP Fund's holdings are in "war shares". But while daily newspapers 
have highlighted the issue with splashy headlines since the start 
of the war against Iraq -- Svenska Dagbladet recently headlined "Millions 
of Swedes Have Invested in War Industry" -- most Swedes do not seem 
too bothered by the revelations. The expected outrage and indignation, 
in this very politically-correct country, just are not there. This 
is despite the fact that Swedish anti-war sentiment is at its highest 
since the Vietnam War and opinion polls show an overwhelming majority 
are opposed to the US-led military action in Iraq. Neither Banco nor 
the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society had registered any complaints 
or comments from Swedes in spite of the heavy media attention. Equally 
ambivalent do Swedes appear to be over reports that Swedish Prime 
Minister Goeran Persson, a staunch opponent of the war which he calls 
"a violation of international law", owns war shares through funds 
in his private investment portfolio. As do Finance Minister Bosse 
Ringholm, Industry Minister Leif Pagrotsky, Defense Minister Leni 
Bjoerklund and Agriculture Minister Ann-Christin Nykvist. The lack 
of indignation may be due to a slow erosion of opposition to the Iraq 
war. Two polls published last week showed opposition had fallen since 
the start of the war, from 81 to 68 percent in one survey and from 
68 to 62 percent in the other. The Swedish Consumer Agency has however 
reacted angrily to the ethical funds' investments and says it plans 
to look into the issue. "It's not very ethical. Few consider a company 
that manufactures war materiel ethical," financial division manager 
Peter Knutsson said. po/jh/hd Iraq-war-Sweden-economy-funds-pensions-ethics

The collision of a car carrying containers of petrol and diesel into 
the walls of the British embassy compound here was an "accident", 
a foreign ministry spokesman said Tuesday. "This accident, in which 
the driver unfortunately lost his life, was due to speeding," said 
Hamid Reza Asefi, cited by the official IRNA news agency. "The accident 
happened after rain fell last night which made the road slippery," 
he added. Diplomatic sources said the British were investigating the 
incident, and they believed it was "still a possibility" it was an 
attack. "Precautions have been taken" around the embassy, a spokesperson 
told AFP. The car smashed into the walls of the embassy compound late 
Monday and burst into flames, killing the driver but injuring nobody 
inside the building, according to Iranian officials. The 35-year-old 
driver worked for the energy ministry, they said, adding that he was 
not believed to have had "political motives." Britain's Home Secretary 
David Blunkett had said there was no immediate evidence it was a terrorist 
act. On Friday after a massive demonstration against the war against 
Iraq by the United States and Britain, hundreds of protesters hurled 
stones at the British embassy, breaking several windows. sgh-lal/dab

Virus outbreak to cast a pall over Asian economies: investment bank 
ATTENTION - UPDATES Hong Kong toll, adds background, details /// HONG 
KONG, April 1 (AFP) - The deadly outbreak of viral pneumonia is casting 
a dark cloud over Asian economies, with growth rates this year likely 
to be slashed by up to 1.5 percentage points, an investment bank said 
Tuesday. "We are of the view that economic growth will slow in Asia 
as a result of the decline in the two pillars of Asia's economies 
-- tourism and private consumption," BNP Paribas Peregrine said in 
a report. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) erupted in 
southern China's Guangdong province in November, spread to Hong Kong 
and onwards to other parts of the world, killing more than 60 people 
so far. The virus has so far claimed 16 lives in Hong Kong and infected 
685, with tourism and aviation industries throughout Asia suffering 
as travellers choose to stay home. "The SARS epidemic will cast a 
long dry spell on tourism and its associated industries. We expect 
the airline, hotel, trade, retail and property sectors to be adversely 
affected by the pneumonia problem," BNP Paribas Peregrine said. The 
report cited comments by travel booking firm Abacus, which handles 
reservations for 80 percent of Hong Kong's travel agents, saying sales 
have fallen about a third from a year ago. Airlines have cut their 
services due to both the Iraq war and the virus, with services to 
and from Hong Kong being the worst affected. However, the report added 
some sectors such as supermarkets, newspapers and television stations 
would benefit from the public preference to stay home. The cuts to 
economic growth forecasts for the region have also been made as it 
becomes clear the US-led war in Iraq will last longer than initially 
expected. This is a bigger factor than SARS in some countries such 
as South Korea where BNP Paribas has cut its growth forecast to 4.0 
percent from 5.1 percent. But for much of Asia, the virus is arguably 
a bigger problem, the report said. The biggest growth forecast cut 
is for Singapore, which is heavily reliant on tourism. Growth this 
year is now seen at 2.5 percent, down from 4.0 percent. Hong Kong's 
expected growth has been cut to 0.9 percent from 1.5 percent, Taiwan 
to 3.9 percent from 4.3 percent and Malaysia to 4.0 percent from 4.7 
percent. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Thailand's growth is seen easing 
to 3.5 percent from 4.0 percent forecast earlier, Indonesia is seen 
falling to 3.9 percent from 4.3 percent and the Philippines is estimated 
at 3.0 percent, down from 3.5 percent. BNP Paribas Peregrine is maintaining 
its 7.4 percent growth forecast for China, which is less dependent 
on tourism, but said the estimate could be cut by 0.2 to 1.0 percentage 
points if the situation worsens. Dutch banking group ABN Amro on Monday 
cut its economic growth forecast for Hong Kong this year by 0.5 percentage 
points to 3.5 percent due to the impact of SARS. Deutsche Bank said 
last week the disease could reduce Hong Kong's growth by 0.4 percentage 
points from the earlier forecast 3.3 percent. bro/dv Health-pneumonia-Asia-economy

Saudi shares ended the first three months of 2003 up 10.4 percent 
as the index hit a nine-month high amid heavy trading as the US-led 
war rages on in Iraq, traders said. The Tadawul All-Shares Index (TASI) 
finished the first quarter on 2,779.10 points from the 2002 closing 
of 2,518.08 points. It is the highest level seen since early July 
last year. The TASI is still down five percent from its all-time high 
of 2,927.23 points recorded on May 20 last year. The market, the most 
vibrant in the Arab world, witnessed the most hectic activity after 
the outbreak of the war on March 20. Since then it has soared about 
10 percent. Economists attributed the increase to initial expectations 
the war would be short, coupled with the fact that prices of most 
shares had dropped sharply in January and February over war fears. 
Abundant cashflow, low interest rates and the wait-and-see attitude 
in other sectors have attracted new funds into the market. Turnover 
in the first three months was 44.1 billion riyals (11.75 billion dollars) 
which is almost one-third of last year's value and half of all 2002. 
Some 481.8 million shares changed hands during the period. The market 
was positively influenced by the listing on January 25 of Saudi Telecom 
which has become the largest firm on the bourse in terms of market 
value, trading and share price increase. Saudi Telecom shares have 
shot up 34.9 percent since floatation, followed by the Saudi Electricity 
Co. (SEC), the third largest firm, which rose 29.5 percent. Saudi 
Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), which ranks second, gained 8.8 percent. 
Together the nine listed commercial banks, Saudi Telecom, SEC and 
SABIC make up 85 percent of the market capitalization. TASI has the 
highest capitalization of any stock market in the Arab world at about 
98 billion dollars at the end of the first quarter of 2003, but operates 
only as an interbank system. oh/bp/dab Stocks-Saudi

Indonesia on Tuesday announced new measures to combat Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and said a woman hospital patient may 
be the first victim within the country. "We suspect that she might 
be suffering from SARS but we have to wait for the incubation period," 
said Health Minister Achmad Suyudi. He said the woman, who has been 
transferred to a North Jakarta hospital designated to treat SARS patients, 
had been in contact with someone from Singapore but gave no details. 
Suyudi said he would issue an order Thursday forcing people either 
suffering from SARS or suspected to be infected to undergo hospital 
treatment. A 17-year-old Indonesian student in Singapore has contracted 
SARS after visiting the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and 
Hong Kong with his brother and parents. Suyudi told reporters a female 
Indonesian worker is in hospital in Hong Kong with the viral disease. 
He was speaking after a meeting at the office of top welfare minister 
Yusuf Kalla on ways to guard against the potentially deadly infection. 
Suyudi said the government was importing face masks from China and 
the United States. Indonesia has no confirmed cases despite its proximity 
to Singapore, which has 92 reported cases including four deaths. Indonesia 
also announced closer checks on incoming travellers. The immigration 
department said its staff, who were wearing masks, were watching arriving 
passengers at air and sea ports for any symptoms. Incoming passengers 
must fill in a health form. "Any suspicious cases will be set apart 
by quarantine officials and if they are ascertained to be carrying 
the disease, we will deport them to their country of departure as 
the law stipulates," said department spokesman, Ade Endang Dahlan. 
The number of ferry passengers between Indonesia's Batam island and 
nearby Singapore has fallen by some 40 percent, the state Antara news 
agency said. Authorities and hoteliers in Batam distributed thousands 
of masks. The health ministry has opened special phone lines for inquiries 
and briefed hospitals across the country on the disease. bs/vt/sm/cl

China on Tuesday rejected as "irresponsible" a US report that accused 
the country of having a poor human rights record and told the United 
States stop meddling in the affairs of other nations. "It made no 
regard of the facts and made irresponsible accusations of China's 
human rights situation," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said. 
"We've been protecting and promoting human rights," Liu said at a 
regular press briefing. "We would like to use this opportunity to 
ask the United States not to interfere in other people's internal 
affairs." The United States on Monday accused China's communist leaders 
of presiding over a "poor" human rights record last year, saying the 
government continued to commit numerous and serious abuses. It highlighted 
the arrests of democracy activists, the imposition of death sentences 
without due process on two Tibetans, and the trials of labor leaders 
on subversion charges. It said China was also quick to suppress religious, 
political and social groups, as well as individuals perceived to be 
a threat to government power or to national stability, including citizens 
who sought to express openly dissenting political and religious views. 
Human rights have long been a source of contention between the two 
countries, which while enjoying improved relations in the past year 
due to cooperation in fighting terrorism and booming trade, have not 
ironed out key differences such as rights matters. cs/ph/sdm/cl US-rights-China-reax

The European Central Bank is likely to hold its fire on interest rates, 
at least until the economic fog from the war in Iraq begins to lift, 
analysts here predicted on Tuesday. Nevertheless, the guardian of 
the euro is likely to ease monetary conditions in the euro area fairly 
soon in order to give the region's economy a much-needed boost, ECB 
watchers said. In a poll of 32 economists by AFP and its financial 
news subsidiary AFX, 28 predicted the ECB would hold its key interest 
rates steady when it holds its next regular policy-setting meeting 
in Rome on Thursday. The bank last trimmed euro-zone borrowing costs 
by a quarter of percentage point to 2.50 percent on March 6. But since 
then, comments by ECB officials have appeared to suggest the central 
bank will not be panicked into acting again too quickly, even as economic 
prospects for the single currency area appear to darken by the day. 
Only last week, the ECB's chief economist Otmar Issing warned against 
expecting too much of the ECB during the Iraq war. Issing told the 
European Parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee in Brussels 
that central banks must help strengthen confidence in the current 
circumstances. But he added: "It also means cautioning against exaggerated 
expectations." The Spanish member of the ECB's executive board Eugenio 
Domingo Solans also warned against acting too hastily and Bundesbank 
President Ernst Welteke stuck his neck out even further, saying last 
week that the ECB is unlikely to cut its key interest rates while 
the economic fallout from Iraq remains unclear. "I am personally of 
the view that the effects of Iraq on the international situation are 
not clear," said Welteke, who as head of the German central bank sits 
on the ECB's governign council. "If they are not clearer (by April 
3), we will assess the situation but we will not take a decision," 
he said. It all depends on how long the hostilities last. If they 
are over quickly, there is a hope falling oil prices and rising confidence 
will trigger the long-awaited turnaround. But if the war drags on 
for months, sapping confidence and threatening to drag the world economy 
into recession, the ECB will have no choice but to lower borrowing 
costs. The markets believe the latter scenario is more likely, a view 
backed up by the latest data. On Monday, the European Commission in 
Brussels calculated that, in March, business and economic confidence 
in Europe suffered its worst slump since the September 11, 2001 terror 
attacks in March. And in Paris on Tuesday, the French statistics institute 
INSEE calculated that household confidence in France fell sharply 
again in March to its lowest level since December 1996. Commerzbank 
economists Ralph Solveen and Christopher Weil said such data would 
provide a further argument for the ECB, but not as early as this week. 
"The gloomier economic outlook means greater pressure on the ECB to 
lower interest rates, but it will probably not act this week. We're 
nevertheless predicting another quarter-point cut this spring," they 
said. BNP Paribas Raymond van der Putten also said: "Given the lack 
of visibility, the ECB is likely to keep its rates unchanged at the 
meeting in Rome on Thursday." The ECB meets twice a year at venues 
outside its Frankfurt headquarters. "So far, it has always avoided 
taking significant monetary policy decisions at out-of-town occasions, 
which are more meant as public relations exercises," van der Putten 
said. But he, too, was believed the ECB "has not yet reached the end 
of its cutting cycle" and he was expecting a further rate cut of as 
much as half a percentage point "in May or June," unless high wage 
inflation and rising fiscal deficits prevented the ECB from acting. 
Goldman Sachs economists agreed. "No rate cut can be expected this 
week, but we see a half-point cut in the pipeline in the next few 
months," they wrote in a research note. spm/hd Iraq-war-ECB-eurozone-bank-economy-rate-forex

The United States is preparing a government with 23 ministries, each 
headed by an American, to rule Iraq once President Saddam Hussein 
has been overthrown, The Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday, quoting 
sources close to the planning. Areas of Iraq declared "liberated" 
by US commander General Tommy Franks will be transferred to the temporary 
government, which will be under the overall control of Jay Garner, 
the former US general appointed to head a military occupation of Iraq, 
the British paper said. In anticipation of the Baghdad regime's fall, 
members of this interim government have begun arriving in Kuwait, 
the left-wing daily added. Under the plan, each of the new government's 
ministries would have four Iraqi advisers appointed by Washington, 
the Guardian said. It said decisions on the government's composition 
appeared to be entirely in US hands, particularly those of deputy 
Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz. This has annoyed Garner, who is 
officially in charge but who has had to accept a number of Iraqis 
favoured by Wolfowitz in advisory roles, the Guardian said. ib-pk/msa/ds

The United States has no real interest in a Middle East peace and 
instead wants to "remodel" the region, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 
charged Tuesday in a biting interview in an Austrian daily. "The current 
American government gives no particular importance to the peace process," 
Assad told Der Standard in reference to efforts to revive peace talks 
between Israel and the Palestinians after the war in Syria's neighbor 
Iraq. "They sometimes make proposals... but Israel rejects them. Israel 
does not want peace... and the Americans have no vision," he said 
in the latest of an increasingly bitter war of words between Washington 
and Damascus. Charging that the United States "has lost touch with 
the world," he said the world's biggest military power was making 
war instead of helping matters and "when a superpower makes a mistake, 
the whole world suffers." By waging war on Iraq, the United States 
has shown that it really "wants oil and to remodel the entire region," 
he said. "It will cause trouble around the entire world, not only 
here. And it will ruin their own interests, both economic and other," 
he said. "We see (anti-war) demonstrations everywhere. They are reactions 
to their hegemonic aims and this reaction will continue to grow," 
the Syrian president warned. US-Syrian relations grew tense after 
US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on Friday accused Syria of allowing 
military supplies to transit across its territory into Iraq, and called 
this a "hostile act." Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara shot 
back Monday that he hoped US and British forces would be defeated 
in Iraq. "Syria's interest lies in seeing the invaders defeated in 
Iraq. The US government has led the American people towards catastrophe 
by setting them off against the entire international community," the 
foreign minister said in comments in the official al-Baath daily.

US military "very sorry" seven civilians killed at Iraqi checkpoint 
by Lachlan Carmichael ATTENTION - ADDS legal advisor, marine quotes 
/// CENTRAL IRAQ, April 1 (AFP) - US forces pushing toward Baghdad 
are "very sorry" that they killed seven Iraqi civilian women and children 
whose vehicle failed to halt at a checkpoint in central Iraq, a field 
commander told AFP Tuesday. "We're very concerned about it and very 
sorry that it happened," Major General Buford Blount, division commander 
of the Third Infantry Division, said. But he stressed that, with US 
soldiers on edge after a suicide car bomb attack Saturday that killed 
four comrades, the unit that opened fire on the minibus had respected 
its rules of engagement. His words echoed an official statement issued 
by US Central Command, which in part read: "In light of recent terrorist 
attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint 
to avoid the unnecessary loss of life." The shooting occurred Monday 
at a checkpoint near Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad. 
The seven victims were in a vehicle peppered with shots by soldiers 
from Blount's division. US military officials in Qatar said the vehicle 
had not stopped at the checkpoint despite the US troops reportedly 
firing warning shots. Two other people in the vehicle were wounded, 
while four escaped unharmed. Blount was at a loss to say why the vehicle 
did not heed instructions to stop before the checkpoint, and speculated 
that maybe they "were trying to escape from Karbala and thought this 
was a regime checkpoint." He said he had heard that Iraqi death squads 
had taken over homes in Karbala, which lies north of Najaf, and were 
forcing families living near a hospital to leave. He also said that 
his forces had in one encounter seen Iraqi fighters herding women 
and children ahead of them as human shields. In that incident, one 
woman who broke away was shot in the back by the Iraqis and US troops 
put up a smokescreen to rescue her and fly her out for medical treatment. 
The general said that his men had experienced "lots of contact" in 
the region and believed that Iraqi militias loyal to President Saddam 
Hussein were moving their fighters around using buses. Because of 
the hostile situation, the soldiers who killed the civilians Monday 
had merely been enforcing security measures, he said. "The bus committed 
a hostile act. It may have been unintentional," he said. Captain Jack 
Pritchard, a legal advisor to the troops, said that the rules of engagement 
obliged troops to use the minimal amount of force necessary to stop 
a threat and minimise collateral damage but in some instances you 
can use deadly force. "After the taxi thing (Saturday's suicide attack) 
and the bus, we thought: how can you change the rules (of engagement). 
You can't and not violate the laws of war," said Pritchard. "When 
we fight a fair fight and they don't, our soldiers are going to die. 
We are just going to have to live with that." Marine Sergeant Christian 
Driotez said that while some Iraqis had been approaching checkpoints 
with white flags, others had been pulling up close by and shooting. 
"We do everything possible to get a positive ID before we even fire 
a round off," said Driotez. "I think we have been as careful as we 
can be distinguishing between civilians and guerrillas." Orders were 
now going out to try to limit repeats of such incidents, particularly 
by way of putting up more barriers before the checkpoints to force 
drivers to a complete halt well before the troop positions, Blount 
said. Civilians would also be encouraged to stay at home and not move 
around. lc/co/kir Iraq-war-US-checkpoint-general

A special court has summoned India's deputy premier L.K. Advani and 
six top Hindu nationalist leaders in connection with the 1992 razing 
of a mosque that sparked bloody riots, a report said Tuesday. The 
Press Trust of India (PTI) said besides Advani, Human Resources Minister 
Murli Manohar Joshi, former cabinet sports minister Uma Bharti and 
Ashok Singhal, president of the hardline Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World 
Hindu Council) are under orders to appear before the court on April 
16. The summons were issued Monday and were mailed to the seven leaders. 
Advani, Singhal, Bharti and several others have been named in police 
reports as encouraging a frenzied mob of several thousand Hindu zealots 
who tore down the Babri mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya on 
December 6, 1992. Hindus claim it was the birthplace of their god 
Ram and a temple had existed there before the mosque. They claimed 
they wanted to rebuild a temple. The ensuing religious bloodbath left 
more than 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless across 
India. Officials told PTI that the special court, which has sweeping 
powers, can issue arrest warrants if the seven do not obey the summons 
and participate in the long-drawn out criminal trial of the demolition 
of the mosque. The summons came a day after the Supreme Court booted 
out a plea by the Hindu nationalist government to lift a ban on worship 
near the Babri mosque rubble, which is claimed by both Hindus and 
Muslims. The order humiliated Advani's Hindu nationalist BJP party, 
which heads the coalition government, and had been hoping to reap 
political benefit by reopening the sealed site to Hindu worshippers. 
The government last month asked the court to lift its ban on any religious 
activity on 67 acres (27.11 hectares) of land near the demolished 
mosque in the town of Ayodhya, 434 miles (700 kilometres) south of 
Delhi. But the court said the government's request was rejected "to 
maintain communal harmony" at the site, which is heavily barricaded 
and barred to civilians. It said its earlier order banning all religious 
activity on the site would continue until the dispute over the ownership 
of the land was settled by a court dealing with it in the northern 
city of Allahabad. pc/an/sdm India-temple

France's Societe Generale Group Tuesday said it would establish this 
week a joint venture fund management with Chinese steel conglomerate 
Shanghai Baosteel Group. The joint venture unites Societe Generale's 
fund management group, SG Asset Management Co. (SGAM), and Baosteel's 
Fortune Trust and Investment Co. in a deal that was officially approved 
last October. SGAM paid four million dollars for its 33 percent of 
the new company headquartered in the eastern city of Shanghai, which 
plans to begin business with registered capital of 100 million yuan 
(12 million US dollars). But before Fortune SGAM begins trading its 
umbrella fund, made up of three main funds including a bond fund, 
an equity fund and a fund made up of both types of securities, it 
will seek to raise three billion yuan in capital, said Dennis Lefranc, 
deputy general manager of Fortune SGAM. "We will raise three billion 
yuan, but that is actually quite difficult to predict," Lefranc said. 
"Market conditions are very difficult. Now everything is very volatile." 
If the funds' performance goes well, SG Asset hopes to increase its 
stake in the venture to 49 percent, the maximum allowed for a foreign 
company according to rules set out when China joined the World Trade 
Organization in December of 2001. While strict regulations set by 
the Chinese government will not allow the reduction of risk with complex 
derivatives, which is common in developed markets, the funds will 
bring an additional investment tool to China's nascent stockmarkets, 
Lefranc said. Sino-foreign fund management joint ventures approved 
in recent weeks hope to some of more than one trillion dollars in 
China's household savings, which are largely idling in domestic banks 
at annual interest rates of 1.98 percent. Last month ING Group's fund 
management arm, ING Investment Management and China Merchants Fund 
Management became the mainland's first joint venture to launch open-ended 
umbrella funds. Another foreign company that has established a fund 
management joint venture is fellow Dutch financial group and rival 
ABN Amro. Allianz, Invesco and Fortis are awaiting final approval 
to launch their own funds. bms/bro China-SocieteGenerale-France-company-fund

Japan Post kicks off to fanfare, anxiety in 'first step' to privatisation 
by Ryan Nakashima = (PICTURE) = ATTENTION - ADDS details, quotes /// 
TOKYO, April 1 (AFP) - Japan Post kicked off its first day as a corporation 
Tuesday to fanfare and anxiety as it took over the nation's postal 
services and a massive 359 trillion yen (three trillion dollars) in 
savings and insurance funds. President Masaharu Ikuta, noting the 
biggest change in the postal services' 132-year history, promised 
to improve services and vowed the firm would accumulate net profit 
of 4.0 trillion yen in the four years to March 2007. "We promise to 
work together so that people will say that postal services have improved 
since the launch of Japan Post," Ikuta said at a banner-unveiling 
ceremony at the headquarters in Tokyo. The mail delivery business 
was expected to post a 2.6 billion yen net loss in the year to March 
2004, smaller than the 16.6 billion yen loss a year earlier, a Japan 
Post spokeswoman said. The three services as a whole posted a 671.9 
billion yen net profit in the year to March 2002. Prime Minister Junichiro 
Koizumi said it was a "first step" in realising one of his long-cherished 
pet reform projects, hatched even before becoming president of the 
Liberal Democratic Party. "This is effectively the first step toward 
privatisation," he said. "I want them to improve management and privatise 
this business smoothly so the government can sell their shares in 
it at high prices." The government planned to capitalise Japan Post 
with at least one trillion yen. Ikuta, lauded as a champion of reform 
for helping resuscitate Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Japan's second largest 
shipping company, as its chairman, said he hoped to achieve the profit 
goal through greater efficiency rather than job cuts. Vice President 
Toshihiro Takahashi, a former Toyota Motor Corp. managing director, 
was also expected to bring Toyota-style efficiencies to the company. 
But critics wondered whether the team could succeed in steering the 
massive postal system, with 280,000 employees and 24,700 post offices 
nationwide, toward privatisation. "The original idea of the reform 
was to break the monopoly on postal services and reform the postal 
savings and insurance systems, which can cause chaos in the financial 
markets," the Mainichi newspaper wrote in an editorial Tuesday. "The 
route from public corporation to privatisation must be made clear, 
but so far, we have seen no signposts," it said. No new nationwide 
mail delivery entrants have appeared, most likely due to the rule 
by the Posts Ministry requiring that 99,000 new postboxes be set up 
nationwide, a number equivalent to 60 percent of the existing postboxes. 
As of Tuesday, only five motorcycle-based parcel delivery firms had 
applied to provide services in limited regions in which postboxes 
were not required. Some also wondered if a privatised corporation 
would continue its massive purchase of government bonds. Together, 
the postal savings and postal insurance schemes made up the largest 
holder of government bonds, holding 94 trillion of the 470 trillion 
yen in circulation by March 2002, said ministry official Daisuke Kitabayashi. 
Japan Post plans to maintain up to some 96 percent of its funds in 
domestic corporate and government bonds, and even if privatised, it 
would be done in a way to maintain its important role in financing 
government spending, he said. Masuhisa Kobayashi, fixed income analyst 
with Merrill Lynch, said the plan was fine as long as deflation, which 
raises the value of bonds, persists. If not, a privatised Japan Post 
might choose to move its massive investment funds elsewhere. "The 
investment plan seems very conservative right now," he said. "But 
if deflation ends, I think a very big problem will arise." mis-rn/ja/dv

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US media warned Tuesday of the impact 
US troops' accidental killing of civilians will have on public opinion 
in Iraq and the Middle East, the New York Times noting that the Saddam 
Hussein regime wants just that. For its part, the Wall Street Journal 
strives to defend US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld -- widely criticized 
currently for the perceived under-deployment of troops in the region. 
While Iraqi civilians show tendencies of wanting to entrust themselves 
to US liberators, according to The Washington Post, they are wary 
lest western forces leave, "as they did in 1991" without Saddam's 
grip truly being broken. And the balancing act for military commanders 
to both minimize civilian casualties yet target Iraqi military "is 
clearly growing harder," the Post added, noting the tragic incident 
near Karbala Monday when US forces opened fire on a vehicle that approached 
a US position, killing at least 10 people, including several children. 
"Even if accidental, such events, like the deaths of civilians in 
Baghdad attributed to errant US bombs, can incur large political costs 
both in and outside Iraq," the Post said. The New York Times concurs, 
stating that, "... billions around the globe are seeing and hearing 
reports that women and children were gunned down yesterday while riding 
in a civilian van at an American checkpoint. "This is just what the 
Iraqi commanders have in mind when they send soldiers disguised as 
noncombatants to fire on unsuspecting American troops. The killing 
of the soldiers is an incidental benefit. The real goal is to turn 
the Americans against Iraqi civilians and cause them to behave like 
a hostile occupying army rather than the friendly liberators we had 
envisioned." And US promises of an investigation "will mean very little 
in the Arab world, particularly if such scenes become routine. If 
that happens, the political war for Iraq could be lost even before 
the military one is won, said the Times. The Wall Street Journal writes 
in defense of Rumsfeld, widely assailed for having given "bum advice" 
to US President George W. Bush, and living proof that "an unbending 
rule of Washington life is that the one thing critics can never forgive 
you for is being right." "Judging by all of the blind-quote vituperation 
the Secretary of Defense is receiving, a casual reader might be surprised 
to learn that we haven't yet lost the Iraq war. US troops are within 
50 miles of Baghdad, probing Republican Guard lines that are being 
shredded from the air. The surrounded enemy has suicide bombers, guerrilla 
harassment and Peter Arnett left as an offensive strategy. We can 
hit the enemy, he can't much hit us." The main charge against Rumsfeld 
is his success in having military chiefs come up with a war plan that 
"did more than repeat the 500,000-man deployment and strategy of the 
Gulf War," the Journal said. "This has offended some of the armchair 
generals who are claiming through the fog of television that we should 
have had more troops on the ground." Moreover, "Mr. Rumsfeld inherited 
the rump Clinton model" of the US armed forces, the Journal adds, 
"about 40 percent smaller in troops, older planes and ships" despite 
having sought congressional support to build up forces. And it warns 
that criticism is piling on Rumsfeld in the hope "of dividing the 
President from his Defense chief," though, in fact, his war plan "seems 
to be succeeding very well" with public support "firming behind it." 
"The one fatal attraction would be to fall now for a "diplomatic pause" 
or cease fire. As we heard Mr. Rumsfeld say on Sunday, that isn't 
part of his plan." jlp/fgf Iraq-war-US-press

A man with two hand grenades is holding an airliner with 46 people 
on board hostage at Havana's international airport, demanding that 
he be flown to Miami, officials said early Tuesday. The Soviet-made 
AN-24 airliner was en route from Nueva Gerona to Havana when the hijacker 
ordered the crew to head for Miami but had to land at Jose Marti International 
Airport because it had insufficient fuel, officials said in a statement. 
The airliner is parked on the tarmac, surrounded by police, as authorities 
"do their utmost to seek a solution that ensures the safety and lives 
of the passengers," the officials added. The hijacker aboard the plane 
is threatening to detonate both his hand grenades if his demand to 
be flown to Miami is not met, they said. "The individual is at the 
back of the plane, apparently with two hand grenades, and he could 
possibly have some accomplices" on boar, the statement added. All 
flights in and out of the airport have been canceled and inconvenienced 
passengers have been put up at hotels in Havana. The plane was hijacked 
Monday at around 9:30 pm (0130 GMT Tuesday) after taking off from 
Nueva Gerona, on the Island of Youth some 150 kilometers (93 miles) 
south of the capital, the statement said. The airplane is carrying 
40 adults, including the crew, and six children, the official statement 
said. "This act (of piracy) is the direct result of the encouragement 
US authorities have given hijackers with their incomprehensible behavior 
in the wake of the March 19 hijacking of a (Cuban) DC-3 airliner to 
the United States by six terrorists armed with knives," the Cuban 
official statement said. "The responsibility for what will happen 
(with Monday's hijacking) will fall entirely on the government" of 
the United States, the statement added. The Cuban statement referred 
to the March 19 hijacking to Florida of another Cuban airliner with 
33 people on board after it also flew out of the Island of Youth. 
That plane was forced to land by US warplanes in Key West, Florida's 
southernmost island, where the hijackers were taken into custody. 
Eleven of the passengers sought political asylum in the United States; 
the rest returned to Cuba. A US judge later ruled that the six hijackers 
could be released on a 25,000 dollar bond pending trial, but the decision 
is pending an appeal by federal lawyers. Cuban President Fidel Castro 
criticized the judge's decision and asked if the United States planned 
to put the six hijackers in a "gilded cage," wondering how their treatment 
would compare with the spartan conditions meted out to al-Qaeda and 
Taliban members confined at the US base in Guantanamo, Cuba. Cuba 
has also been critical of the US policy of granting asylum to any 
Cuban who manages to set foot on US soil -- like the 11 passengers 
on the March 19 flight. Those intercepted on the high seas are returned 
to the communist island. fgf/jlp Cuba-plane

The estimated death toll in Thailand's brutal drugs crackdown has 
risen to more than 2,000, police said Tuesday as the kingdom entered 
the third month of a self-declared war on methamphetamines. A total 
of 2,052 people have been murdered across the country since the drugs 
war began February 1, including 46 people who police have shot dead 
in self-defence, national Thai police spokesman Pongsapat Pongcharoen 
said in a statement. Six police officers were killed over the same 
period, while 15 were injured, he said. "The police chief is satisfied 
with the results over the past two months," Pongsapat said. While 
police are unable to say precisely how many of the killings were drugs-related, 
the national murder tally has been widely used as a proxy figure for 
the number of deaths resulting from the no-holds-barred drugs war. 
Authorities have repeatedly said that the rest were murders carried 
out by drug gang members in a bid to protect themselves from prosecution. 
Arrests over the period now totalled 46,776, while police seized 12.51 
million methamphetamine tablets and 641 million baht (14.94 million 
dollars) worth of property belonging to suspected traffickers, Pongsapat 
said. "For the third month, police will focus on the arrests of big 
drugs traders and investigate further to see whether they can seize 
property believed to belong to those involved in the drugs business," 
he added. Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra is spearheading the war 
on drugs aimed at stamping out the rampant methamphetamine trade here, 
most of which flows in from neighbouring Myanmar and is allegedly 
produced by an ethnic Wa group aligned with Yangon. tp/sb/mlm/th Thailand-drugs

Singapore share prices closed 1.16 percent higher Tuesday after recent 
sharp falls as investors looked to amass bargain stocks, but worries 
of the protracted war in Iraq remained, dealers said. The Straits 
Times Index gained 14.76 points to 1,282.58, off its intraday high 
of 1,292.24 as profit-taking set in, and All-Singapore Equities index 
rose 3.51 points to 344.37. "Overall, the market is looking good. 
Although volume has not been high, movements have been rather slow," 
a dealer at a local brokerage said. "It is probably a 'slow and steady' 
uptrend, rather than one of those strong spikes," the dealer said. 
Volume traded totalled 295.16 million shares worth 412.28 million 
Singapore dollars (234.25 million US), up from 275.21 million shares 
worth 433.36 million dollars on Monday. There were 145 rising issues, 
77 decliners and 342 issues were even. Singapore Telecommunications 
was three cents higher at 1.37 after announcing Monday it planned 
to list its postal unit SingPost. Bank stocks also rebounded after 
posting sharp falls on Monday, led by United Overseas Bank which added 
30 cents to 10.60, DBS was five cents up at 9.25 but Oversea-Chinese 
Banking Corp. dropped five cents to 9.40. Singapore Airlines was 10 
cents up at 8.85, electronic contract manufacturer Venture Corp. also 
rose by the same amount to 14.10 and Creative Technology was 40 cents 
firmer at 11.10. bh/dv Stocks-Singapore

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell left 
the US capital early Tuesday on a hastily-arranged trip to Ankara 
and Brussels discuss the war against Iraq with Turkish, NATO and EU 
officials. Powell, who has been criticized for not traveling more 
to build support for the conflict, left Washington around 5:30 am 
(1030 GMT). He is expected to return on Thursday, spokesman Richard 
Boucher said. "In Ankara, Secretary Powell will meet with Turkish 
leaders to strengthen our relationship," Boucher told reporters, referring 
to Turkey as "key ally in a key place at a key time." The topics to 
be discussed included Iraq as well as the global war on terrorism 
and Cyprus, he said Monday. "In Brussels, the secretary intends to 
consult with members of the European Union and with NATO. (He) will 
focus on the war in Iraq and also on the broad range of post-conflict 
issues that we want to discuss with our European allies at this time," 
Boucher said. Among the post-conflict matters will be the possible 
participation of European countries and NATO members in peacekeeping 
duties in Iraq after Saddam Hussein has been ousted from power. "On 
the issue of stabilization and peacekeeping in post-Saddam Iraq, obviously 
there's a job that needs to be done," Boucher said. "That job of stabilization, 
that job of maintaining security for the Iraqi people, clearly American 
forces will be there to help with that, but there may be ways of involving 
others as well," he said. In Ankara, Powell will continue to hammer 
home Washington's opposition to Turkish troops entering northern Iraq 
as well as try to iron out festering differences over the deployment 
of US soldiers. Despite support from the new Turkish government, the 
country's parliament has thus far refused to allow US troops to use 
its soil for the Iraq invasion, forcing the Pentagon to revise its 
plans for opening a northern front. Powell could ask Ankara to broaden 
the permission it gave shortly after the war broke out for US warplanes 
to fly over Turkish airspace on their way to Iraq, to include a go-ahead 
for refueling over Turkey. However, Turkey's foreign minister Abdullah 
Gul said Tuesday that his government did not know of any new demands 
by the United States to help out in the war against Iraq. "There is 
nothing planned," Gul told the Anatolia news agency when queried on 
whether Powell would fly into Ankara with new requests. Another crucial 
issue should be Turkey's insistence it may send further troops into 
the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, a move fiercely resisted by Washington. 
Ankara fears that Kurds in northern Iraq could declare an independent 
state, setting a dangerous example to the big Kurdish population in 
Turkey's own south eastern corner, where a separatist uprising killed 
over 36,000 people in the 1990s. At NATO headquarters in the Belgian 
capital, Powell is expected to focus on the alliance's efforts to 
assist in the conflict, primarily with the defense of Turkey which 
proved to be a major source of division last month. Powell's trip 
this week will mark only the third time he has left the western hemisphere 
since November and comes amid criticism that his lack of travel may 
have hurt diplomatic efforts to shore up support for the war, particularly 
with Turkey. The secretary has rejected the criticism, noting that 
he met extensively with Turkish officials in Washington last month 
and in Davos, Switzerland in late January. In addition, he has spoken 
frequently about his four trips to the United Nations in New York 
since January in which he sought to build support for a now-failed 
new UN Security Council resolution that would have authorized the 
use of force against Iraq. Powell also travelled to Asia in late February, 
visiting Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul. mvl-col/fgf Iraq-war-US-Powell

The former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan was accused of imprisoning 
its political opponents Tuesday after an Azeri court handed out hefty 
sentences to leaders of an anti-government protest movement. Four 
men from the town of Nardaran, near the capital Baku, were sentenced 
to between five and nine years in jail for their part in a demonstration 
last year over living conditions which ended in violent clashes with 
police. But supporters of the men said they were innocent of the charges 
and were being victimised because their town is a stronghold of opposition 
to the authocratic rule of Azerbaijan's President Heidar Aliyev. Aliyev, 
a 79-year-old former KGB general, is running for a third term in office 
in presidential elections scheduled for later this year. "These people... 
are political prisoners," said Arzu Abdullayeva, head of the Helsinki 
Citizens' Assembly, a prominent human rights group in Azerbaijan. 
"Their town has no jobs, no electricity, it is hard for them to live. 
They protested to demand their constitutional rights. That is the 
normal right of any citizen but it turns out that in Azerbaijan that 
is not allowed." The four men given jail sentences Tuesday were found 
guilty of organising mass disorder, resisting the police and possessing 
illegal arms. Another 11 defendants walked free after being given 
non-custodial sentences. One of the jailed men, Alikram Aliyev, is 
the chairman of Azerbaijan's outlawed Islamic Party. He was given 
the stiffest sentence of nine years in a penal colony. The verdicts 
are likely to add to international pressure on Azerbaijan, which is 
already under investigation from the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe 
for holding political prisoners. Nardaran, about 30 kilometres (18 
miles) from Baku, was a prosperous town under Soviet rule but now 
-- as in many other places in Azerbaijan -- unemployment is high and 
gas and electricity supplies are frequently cut off. Early last year 
residents began staging demonstrations to demand better living conditions. 
But the protests erupted into violence in June last year when dozens 
of riot police were ordered in to put down the demonstrations. One 
local man died of gunshot wounds, and dozens of police and residents 
were also injured in the clashes. Soon after, police rounded up men 
they suspected of orchestrating the violence. The authorities alleged 
that the people behind the clashes were Islamic radicals who planned 
to overthrow the country's secular government with backing from neighbouring 
Iran. However, Nardaran residents deny there is any political element 
to their protests. They said Tuesday they were deciding whether to 
launch a new round of demonstrations to protest the court's verdict. 
"This is an unjust decision and a violation of the constitution," 
Hadzhiaga Nuriyev, a village elder from Nardaran, said outside the 
court. "We will use all legal means available to get this overturned."

Stock markets stabilised in Asia and Europe on Tuesday, while the 
dollar bounced back slightly and oil prices slipped as traders perked 
up following recent gloom over the war in Iraq. However with little 
visible progress made by US and British troops fighting towards Baghdad, 
the improved sentiment was caused mainly by either bargain hunting 
or a series of individual local factors unconnected to the Gulf. The 
still-volatile situation in Iraq was emphasised overnight as US troops, 
on alert for suicide bombings, shot dead seven women and children 
travelling in a vehicle at a checkpoint in the centre of the country. 
"It's a see-saw market," said analyst Henk Potts of Barclays Stockbrokers. 
"The market is trading very much on the headlines," he said, explaining 
that most gains had been made by dealers seeking to exploit the volatility. 
"There is interest in the market, in buying back some of the sold 
positions," he said, while adding that the short-term outlook remained 
"on the down side". On European markets, the British FTSE 100 index 
edged up 0.3 percent to 3,623.0 points, the German DAX 30 slipped 
0.5 percent to 2,411.5 points and the French CAC 40 was unchanged 
at 2,618.6 points in early trading. The pause for breath had begun 
in Asia, despite continued worries over the economic impact of the 
deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus. Japanese shares 
ended the day slightly higher after buying linked to the start of 
the new Japanese financial year. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei 
225 closed up 14.01 points or 0.18 percent at 7,986.72. South Korea's 
composite index closed up 0.53 percent at 538.56, but Hong Kong prices 
closed 0.44 percent lower at 8,596.89 due to fears about the SARS 
virus. Analysts said the Asian exchanges remained at the mercy of 
events in the Gulf. "If overseas stock markets continue to fall due 
to the uncertainty of the duration of the war in Iraq, the local stock 
market will also continue to be pressured," said Kenji Karikomi, general 
manager at Hinode Securities. The dollar also showed signs of stabilising 
after heavy losses, with some dealers taking the view that recent 
pessimism over Iraq might have been overdone. The euro dipped to 1.0896 
dollars from 1.0933 late on Monday in New York, while the dollar rose 
to 118.04 yen from 117.95. Michael Klawitter, economist at the German 
bank WestLB, said that the steadier tone of the dollar was not surprising 
given the "very substantial sell-off" of the US currency in recent 
days. "We're pretty much back at the levels where we were before all 
this euphoria about a swift military success" by coalition forces 
in Iraq developed, he said. Oil prices also dipped with the news that 
a labour strike in major producer Nigeria was called off, though exports 
continue to be disrupted. The price of reference Brent North Sea crude 
oil for May delivery dropped 28 cents per barrel to 26.90 dollars 
in early trading. The three-day stoppage was to have begun on Tuesday, 
but an overnight meeting with government officials led to its suspension, 
Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) spokesman Owei Lakemfa told AFP. Gold 
prices rose, with the spot price on the London Bullion Market up 1.8 
dollars from the previous closing price at 335.65 dollars. Bond prices 
were up. The yield on the 10-year German government bond dropped two 
basis points, or 0.02 percentage points, to 4.02 percent. Bond yields 
and prices move in opposite directions. burs-pw/dr/hd Markets-world

All sides in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) war agreed Tuesday, 
at the final session of talks aimed at ending the country's four-year 
conflict, to set up a transition government to lead to the first democratic 
elections in 40 years. Some 360 delegates attending the final session 
of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue adopted by acclamation agreements 
reached in Pretoria on December 17 last year, providing for a two-year 
transition government culminating in the DRC's first democratic elections 
since those on independence from Belgium in 1960. They also adopted 
a constitution, which was agreed on March 6. str/jhe/hn/kdz DRCongo-talks

The arrest of four men accused of plotting to blow up a luxury hotel 
in Amman showed Tuesday that the treath of terrorist attacks hangs 
over the Middle East region, and beyond, since the US-led strike on 
Iraq began twelve days ago. Vatican foreign minister Cardinal Jean-Louis 
Tauran warned last week: "This war will give birth to all possible 
types of extremism, including Islamic. We should be aware of that. 
It will cause terrorism." Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for his 
part warned Monday that the "appalling human tragedy" resulting from 
the fighting in Iraq could produce "100 Osama bin Ladens", referring 
to the head of the al-Qaeda terror movement. Jordanian authorities 
arrested four Iraqis on suspicion of plotting to blow up a luxury 
Amman hotel frequented by US nationals and foreign journalists, diplomatic 
sources told AFP Tuesday. And Iraqi diplomats, recently expelled from 
the kingdom, were reportedly planning to poison water supplies serving 
military bases near the Iraqi border used by US personnel, the sources 
said. Last Friday, Washington said it had foiled two Iraqi plots against 
US interests in two unnamed Middle Eastern countries and added that 
similar plans had been uncovered in some ten cities worldwide. That 
same day, President George W. Bush's administration said terrorists 
were planning anti-American attacks in Yemen. It asked some 60 countries 
to expel Iraqi diplomats. "Many went ahead," said a US official, though 
the actual number was 17, expelling a total of 70 diplomats. Meanwhile 
the Palestinian radical movement Islamic Jihad said it had sent suicide 
bombers to Baghdad to fight invading US and British forces, the day 
after a suicide attack in Iraq which killed four US troops, attributed 
to an Iraqi non-commissioned officer but likened to terrorism by the 
Pentagon. The announcement came at the same time as the group claimed 
responsibility for a suicide attack in the Israeli town of Netanya 
Sunday which killed the bomber and injured 26 people, and which the 
group said was "a gift from Palestine to the heroic people of Iraq." 
The fear of attacks has affected Europe, where a survey revealed Monday 
that 69 percent of Spaniards dread operations by hardline Islamist 
groups on their soil. Security has also been stepped up in Britain, 
Germany and France. Britain revised its travel advice for northeast 
and east Malaysia Friday, urging people to take account of the threat 
posed by Philippines-based group Abu Sayyaf. In Chile, the police 
said two attacks against US and Spanish firms were linked to groups 
opposing the war in Iraq. And in the United States Chicago mayor Richard 
Daley announced that the city had closed a downtown airport used mainly 
by private and business aircraft to protect the country's third largest 
city from aerial attack. br/sc/mb Iraq-war-Jordan-threat

A 72-year-old man who was recently in Vietnam was on Tuesday confirmed 
as the first German to have contracted a virulent respiratory illness 
that has killed scores of people around the world. The man, who became 
the fourth case in Germany after three Singaporeans were diagnosed 
with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Frankfurt earlier 
this month, was being treated in a clinic in Hemer in western Germany. 
The patient, who had recently travelled to Vietnam, has been under 
treatment since Friday and his doctor said his condition was improving. 
SARS erupted in southern China's Guangdong province in November, spread 
to Hong Kong and onwards to over a dozen other countries, and has 
killed more than 60 people so far. On Monday, doctors in the southern 
state of Bavaria said they were treating a child of one and a 60-year-old 
man showing the disease's flu-like symptoms. Over the weekend medical 
authorities said they were carrying out tests to try to discover whether 
a man from the southwest city of Mannheim also had the condition. 
A Singaporean doctor who had treated a SARS patient, the doctor's 
wife and his mother-in-law, all of whom were transiting through Frankfurt 
airport, were earlier this month reported to be the first cases of 
the disease in Europe. Their condition has since improved, according 
to doctors. loc/ds Health-pneumonia-Germany

Malaysian stocks closed lower Tuesday as investors reduced their exposure 
because of concerns over the Iraq war and a deadly virus outbreak, 
dealers said. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite index closed 
down 8.61 points or 1.35 percent at 627.11. Dealers said fears of 
a prolonged war in Iraq and the Severe Acute Repiratory Syndrome (SARS) 
outbreak continued to dampen market sentiment. "Although the Health 
Minister said Malaysia is free of SARS, gaming stocks like Genting 
and Resorts have yet to recover from their falls," a dealer from a 
local brokerage said. Some 160.4 million shares were traded, valued 
at about 345.4 million ringgit (91 million dollars). Losers outnumbered 
gainers 291 to 188 while 220 stocks were unchanged and 431 untraded.

The prime ministers and foreign ministers of Turkey and Greece are 
to discuss the divided island of Cyprus on April 8, on the sidelines 
of a summit of Balkan countries, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan said on Tuesday. Turkey will not give up its efforts to end 
the long-running division of Cyprus just because its rival Cypriot 
Greek and Turkish communities failed last month to agree on a United 
Nations plan to reunite the Mediterranean island, Erdogan told parliamentarians 
from his ruling Justice and Development Party. "We want to make new 
openings under Turkey's initiative," Erdogan said. He added that Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Gul was to visit the breakaway Turkish state in 
the north of Cyprus on Thursday to "launch the new steps" ahead of 
the planned Belgrade meeting. "I hope our efforts will make a positive 
contribution the Cyprus problem," Erdogan added. In Athens, a source 
at the diplomatic office of Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis confirmed 
that Turkey had proposed a meeting on the Cyprus question, but said 
it was not yet certain that it would take place. "There has been a 
proposal on the Turkish side and we view it favourably. But it is 
not 100-percent sure and we haven't officially confirmed it yet," 
the source told AFP. The Turkish press has recently reported that 
Ankara was planning to look for a Cyprus solution outside the United 
Nations framework, but there has so far been no official confirmation 
of that. A last-ditch effort by the United Nations to reunify the 
island failed earlier this month when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktash rejected the UN blueprint, to which the Greek Cypriots also 
had objections. The plan was largely regarded as the final chance 
to resolve the island's division before the internationally-recognized 
Greek Cypriot side joins the European Union next year. The EU has 
said that if there is no reunification deal, it will admit only the 
Greek Cypriots. Cyprus has been divided since July 1974 when Turkish 
troops occupied the northern third of the island in reponse to a Greek 
Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece. han/fc/ds Cyprus-Turkey-Greece

North Korea accused the United States Tuesday of stepping up spy flights 
over the Stalinist state in preparation for an invasion once the war 
with Iraq ends, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. Yonhap quoted 
North Korea's official Radio Pyongyang as saying the US military flew 
220 reconnaissance flights over the communist country in March, 40 
more than the previous month. "This shows the US imperialists are 
trying to turn their spearhead of aggression to our republic after 
the war in Iraq," said the North's state radio station, monitored 
by Yonhap in Seoul. The US military conducted surveillance flights 
using RC-135, U-2, EP-3 and RC-7Bs spy planes backed by E-3 early 
warning aircraft, as well as radar-evading F-117 fighters. North Korea's 
state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) also blasted US surveillance 
missions and joint military exercises in South Korea as a prelude 
to war against Pyongyang. "The aerial espionage and war exercises 
go to clearly prove that the US is going to invade the DPRK (North 
Korea) at the end of the Iraqi war," the agency said in a dispatch 
monitored in Seoul. Minju Joson, the North's government newspaper, 
also accused Japan of attempting to strengthen its aerial espionage 
against the communist country on behalf of the United Sates during 
the war in Iraq. "Aerial espionage against a sovereign state is an 
act of encroaching upon its sovereignty," Miju Joson said in a commentary 
carried by KCNA. "Yet, the Japanese reactionaries are zealously following 
the US moves to militarily stifle the DPRK. This will only precipitate 
their self-destruction." The North has repeatedly maintained that 
the United States has been preparing a pre-emptive strike on North 
Korea's suspected nuclear facilities, which have been at the center 
of growing regional tensions. It has frequently denounced on-going 
US-South Korean military exercises, which the US military describes 
as routine and defensive in nature. The nuclear crisis erupted nearly 
six months ago when Washington accused Pyongyang of running a secret 
nuclear weapons program. Last month, four North Korean MiG-19 fighter 
jets intercepted a US reconnaissance plane over international waters 
249 kilometers (150 miles) off the North's eastern coast in what the 
United States described as a dangerous provocation. Washington has 
denied charges that it plans to invade the North and said it is seeking 
a peaceful resolution to the crisis. cw/jkw/sdm NKorea-US-spy

NEAR NAJAF, Iraq, April 1 (AFP) - US troops killed seven women and 
children when they opened fire on a civilian vehicle at a military 
checkpoint, in a harsh setback to coalition efforts to win the affection 
of the Iraqi people. The shooting occurred at a checkpoint manned 
by soldiers from the US Army's Third Infantry Division at Najaf, 150 
kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad, on Monday afternoon, US spokesman 
Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said. He said the victims, 
all women and children, were in a vehicle that failed to stop despite 
repeated warning shots fired by US troops. Two other people in the 
vehicle were wounded, while four others escaped unharmed. The Washington 
Post reported Tuesday that at least 10 civilians had died in the attack, 
including five children. Citing officers on the scene, it said the 
civilians were killed by the 25mm cannon fire, with one man so badly 
injured he was not expected to live. US forces in Iraq have been on 
a heightened state of alert and are approaching Iraqi civilians with 
much greater circumspection following a suicide car bombing near Najaf 
on Saturday that killed four soldiers. Coalition nerves were further 
frayed by reports at the weekend that as many as 4,000 militants had 
poured into Iraq and were prepared to commit similar acts of suicide 
to defend Iraq against the US-British invasion. Well before Saturday's 
car bomb, US officers had been making no secret of their outrage at 
the guerrilla, or "terrorist", tactics they said had been practiced 
by Iraqi forces -- firing from civilian vehicles, faking surrenders 
only to open fire, fighting behind human shields. Troops on the ground 
have also been frustrated -- and surprised -- by Iraqi forces they 
say don civilian clothes and then melt into the general population, 
making it near impossible to distinguish friend from foe. Reacting 
to Monday's shooting, Major General Buford Blount, division commander 
of Third Infantry Division, said Tuesday his troops were "very concerned 
about it and very sorry that it happened." But he stressed that with 
US soldiers on edge after Saturday's suicide car bomb attack, the 
unit that opened fire on the minibus had respected its rules of engagement. 
A written statement issued by US Central Command here early Tuesday 
said initial reports of the checkpoint shooting "indicate the soldiers 
responded in accordance with the rules of engagement to protect themselves". 
"In light of recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers 
exercised considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of 
life." Later Tuesday James Wilkinson, spokesman for the US Central 
Command, described the shooting as an "unfortunate tragedy" and acknowledged 
that young US soldiers could well be "a little jumpy" in the aftermath 
of the suicide car bombing. "While it is a tragedy and we certainly 
grieve for the loss of the innocent," he told a BBC interviewer, "it 
does point out the tactics that this regime is going to use. "In instances 
like this, the fault lies with the regime." Owens said the deaths 
occurred as US troops opened fire on the passenger compartment as 
a last resort after a vehicle ignored hand signals and two warning 
shots and continued moving toward them. "When soldiers opened the 
vehicle, they found 13 women and children inside. Seven of the occupants 
were dead, two were wounded and four were unharmed." As civilian casualties 
mount in Baghdad, where US and British forces are carrying out day 
and night air strikes, the checkpoint shooting was a further blow 
to a US public relations campaign that seeks to portray coalition 
troops as liberators and providers rather than invaders and occupiers. 
"On the hearts and minds front, the war is still not going particularly 
well for the coalition," said Alan Dupont of the Strategic and Defense 
Studies Center at the Australian National University. "While militarily 
they appear to be regaining the initiative, they've still got a lot 
of ground to make up on the public relations psychological warfare 
front." nh-lc/kir Iraq-war-US-checkpoint

Malaysia's health authorities Tuesday announced the country's first 
suspected cases of the deadly pneumonia virus that has sparked a global 
health scare, the official Bernama news agency reported. Health ministry 
director general Mohamad Taha Arif was quoted as saying that eight 
people with suspected symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
(SARS) had been admitted to hospital for tests. A 37-year-old woman 
was in hospital in southern Johor state neighbouring Singapore, which 
has been hard hit by the illness, while the other seven cases were 
reported in and around the capital Kuala Lumpur, he said. The mysterious 
respiratory illness, which first erupted in southern China and has 
been transported to North America and Europe by travellers, has killed 
more than 60 people worldwide. Malaysia's Health Minister Chua Jui 
Meng, who visited Johor state Tuesday, urged the tens of thousands 
of Malaysians working in Singapore to take their annual leave in an 
effort to combat the spread of the disease. "If possible, the Malaysian 
workers are advised to take their annual leave," he was quoted as 
saying by Bernama. Some 50,000 Malaysians commute to-and-fro from 
the island republic daily. The World Health Organisation has listed 
Singapore, Toronto, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Chinese cities 
of Beijing, Shanxi and Guangdong as affected areas. Singapore is among 
the worst hit, with four deaths and the number of reported cases now 
standing at 92, with 47 in hospital and 41 discharged so far. jsm/lb/cl

Vandals have defaced one of the biggest British war cemeteries in 
northern France with graffiti condemning the US-British invasion of 
Iraq, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) said Monday. Insults 
aimed at British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George 
W. Bush were sprayed in red paint over a monument to Britain's dead 
from World War I and discovered by a gardener last Thursday. "It was 
removed by the afternoon but not before a couple of coach loads (of 
visitors) had been through and seen it. We are pretty hacked off and 
I am pleased to say the French authorities are too," said Tim Reeves, 
the CWGC's representative in France. The words "Rosbifs (British) 
go home! Saddam Hussein will win and spill your blood" were painted 
in French over the base of the cemetery's main monument -- an obelisk 
topped by a cross. On one side was a swastika and the words "Death 
to the yankees." Some 11,000 British dead are buried at Etaples, which 
lies on the Channel coast around 15 miles (24 kilometres) south of 
Boulogne. It was the site of several hospitals during World War I.

The US army has suspended training of Iraqi exiles in Hungary after 
a second group completed the programme and headed to the Gulf to help 
US forces liaise with civilians in Iraq, US officials said Tuesday. 
"We suspended the training program because the focus of the US military 
has been shifted on the operations of the coalition forces in Iraq," 
Major Robert Stern, spokesman for the US Training Task Force told 
AFP. "We are turning our focus on the integration of the second group 
of trainees in ongoing operations in Iraq," said Stern. A statement 
from US officials said the volunteers were already making an invaluable 
contribution to the US-led war on Iraq, launched on March 20 aimed 
at toppling Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. "Their knowledge of local 
areas inside Iraq, language skills and the training they received 
... in supporting humanitarian operations make them invaluable contributors 
to coalition efforts," Major General David Barno, the commander of 
the task force, said in the statement. "There is no question in my 
mind that their presence will save lives," he added. The first group 
of Iraqi opposition volunteers who departed for the Gulf about a month 
ago "are already working with US units to coordinate the delivery 
of humanitarian aid" at the southern port of Umm Qasr, he said. Two 
groups of trainees have completed a month-long training programme 
in the southern Taszar base in Hungary, and the second group also 
recently flew out to the Gulf, Stern said. Both groups consisted of 
"a couple dozen" people, according to Hungarian military sources. 
"Free Iraqi Forces are also providing mission planning and interpreter 
assistance to aid displaced persons and deliver critical humanitarian 
relief stocks for Iraqi citizens in need," Barno added in his statement. 
"US Army civil affairs units currently operating in southern Iraq 
have been extremely pleased with the contributions made by the Iraqi 
volunteers already deployed," Barno said. "As country experts on Iraq, 
the volunteers will help ensure that such supplies as blankets, water 
containers, shelter equipment, and essential medicines are effectively 
moved and distributed to locations within Iraq where populations are 
in need of assistance." "These highly committed and trained volunteers 
will be a major force multiplier for our coalition civil affairs units 
in Southwest Asia," said Barno. Stern could not say whether Washington 
planned to resume the training project at a later phase. "Right now 
I could only tell you that our portion of the training has been successfully 
completed. We trained every volunteer that has arrived in Hungary," 
he said. US trainers and support personnel in Hungary "are preparing 
to redeploy to our home bases in stages over the next few weeks," 
he added. Hungary gave the US the green light to train up to 3,000 
Iraqi volunteers until the end of December in civil-military liaison 
tasks to help in the reconstruction of Iraq. est/jkb Iraq-war-Hungary

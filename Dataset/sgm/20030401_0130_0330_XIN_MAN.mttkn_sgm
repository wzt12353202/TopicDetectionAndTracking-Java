 China's  "International  Herald  leader"  Europe  first  published 
 by  the  State  Council  development  research  center  The  Tong 
 Gang  wrote  an  article  entitled  "War  and  oil  need  insulating 
 ",  which  is  transmitted  as  follows  :  War-End  First  World 
 markets  and  the  Iraqi  war  situation  of  Hu  Dongxing  markedly 
 strengthened.  First  two  days,  in  the  war  is  expected  to 
 be  quick,  the  US  unit  sharp  rise  in  oil  prices  drop.  The 
 attack  with  the  action  blocked,  pessimistic  forecast  and  re-build-ups, 
 and  the  possibility  of  higher  oil  prices  again  remains  high. 
 Thus,  a  huge  oil  reserves  in  Iraq,  future  appears  to  be 
 an  element  of  the  world  economy.  What  is  really  so  ?  (subtitle) 
 stems  from  psychological  factors  market  fears  More  generally, 
 there  is  no  denying  that  the  world's  oil  factors,  including 
 long-term  curbed  Iraqi  oil.  However,  this  cannot  be  formed 
 in  the  short  term  and  a  role  to  play.  The  market  between 
 the  war  with  Iraq's  steps  toward  better  relations  are  not 
 expected  to  be  identified.  The  current  oil  market  panic  and 
 the  stock  market  fluctuations,  changes  in  the  major  psychological 
 factors.  Since  economic  fundamentals,  entered  since  February 
 this  year,  the  market  and  did  not  see  new  structural  changes. 
 At  the  same  time,  although  the  international  oil  market  Preheat 
 by  war,  the  latest  data  show  that  the  international  oil 
 production  and  consumption  gap  of  only  1  %,  remained  in 
 7600  to  77  million  barrels  per  day.  Economic  fundamentals 
 and  there  was  no  oil  supply  and  demand  new  shocks,  the 
 market  for  corporate  financial  scandal,  layoffs,  Iraq,  including 
 the  Korean  nuclear  crisis  have  been  used  in  part  the  effects 
 of  these  incidents  have  been  released.  The  Iraqi  issue,  for 
 example,  "was  the"  War  is  expected  to  be  seething  enough 
 has  been  speculation  from  Bush  to  tell  inadvertently  Crusaders 
 East  with  a  new  date,  the  world  economy  has  been  a  substantial 
 damage.  At  a  time  when  the  Iraqi  war  situation  changes, 
 but  is  expected  to  realize  it.  Of  course,  if  the  war  is 
 not  expected  towards  the  direction  of  development,  will  not 
 only  to  oil  prices  are  expected  to  be  more  negative  direction, 
 and  will  stimulate  structural  factors  deteriorating,  the  world 
 economic  recovery  period  will  also  be  extended.  (subtitle) 
 factors  oil  will  not  be  decided  While  it  was  possible  that 
 the  Russian  oil  and  other  European  countries  such  as  France 
 and  Germany  opposed  to  the  US  force  "was  the"  one  of  the 
 reasons,  but  this  factor  in  different  countries  have  a  different 
 meaning,  the  focus  of  attention  is  focused,  and  would  not 
 affect  the  major  an  important  factor  in  the  country's  economy. 
 The  European  countries,  although  the  war  is  expected  to  be 
 long-term,  because  the  rise  in  crude  oil  prices  and  was 
 damaged,  but  the  oil  companies,  such  as  BP,  ENI,  through 
 the  overseas  capital  expansion  has  already  opened  up  new 
 markets,  the  actual  oil  consumption  can  be  guaranteed  not 
 to  mention  the  fact  that  individual  countries,  such  as  Norway 
 have  been  a  fully  developed  external  resources,  and  in  total 
 revenue  from  domestic  resources  development  "on  behalf  of 
 the  fund  under  a"  period.  The  price  of  crude  oil  for  the 
 European  economy  is  a  major  impact  in  the  processing  link, 
 and  this  can  be  found  through  stock  placement.  (subtitle) 
 solution  is  cooperation,  dialogue  The  above  analysis  indicates 
 that  the  war  -  Oil-economic  fundamentals  triangular  relationship 
 is  not  a  result  of  the  changes,  which  is  a  big  psychological 
 expectations  as  a  result  of  the  war.  If  this  conclusion 
 was  established,  it  may  also  address  plight  of  the  fundamental 
 way  out.  First,  the  OPEC  should  not  continue  the  positive 
 role  in  the  international  energy  market  to  belittle.  Otherwise 
 it  will  further  stimulate  market  prices.  The  OPEC,  under 
 the  present  circumstances,  not  only  is  not  a  high-price  oil 
 dollars,  but  also  for  its  market  share  further  blow.  Non-OPEC 
 oil  producing  countries  such  as  Russia  because  of  its  production 
 capacity  is  approaching  the  limit,  but  equally  to  profits. 
 The  rise  in  oil  prices  can  only  benefit  western  oil  capital, 
 and  the  marginal  oil  consumption  for  the  rapid  rise  in  the 
 country's  oil  demand  will  also  have  a  significant  weakening. 
 In  fact,  from  the  Afghanistan  war  and  the  attitude  of  the 
 Iraqi  oil  during  the  war,  the  organization  is  worthy  of 
 a  critical  time  in  the  world  oil  market  "stabilizer  ".  Secondly, 
 OPEC  is  facing  increasingly  fierce  competition  in  international 
 oil  markets  is  an  indisputable  fact.  At  the  international 
 sanctions  on  Iraq's  long-term,  his  volatile  situation  in  the 
 market  share  of  the  threats,  is  to  survive  only  seek  a 
 new  way  out.  To  change  the  flow  of  oil  dollars  to  form 
 a  new  income  -  Capital  return  mechanism  that  OPEC  must  be 
 taken  into  account.  I  believe  that  many  countries  will  be 
 of  interest.  Finally,  if  the  United  States  can  control  process 
 of  war  throughout  the  post-war's  largest  makers  seem  to  be 
 difficult  to  Luobie,  the  United  States  will  increase  oil 
 supply  factors.  Taking  into  account  the  needs  of  the  United 
 States  to  meet  their  own  (  May  2001  under  the  Bush  administration 
 announced  the  "Outline  energy"  in  2040  the  United  States 
 will  bring  the  current  oil  imports  from  11  million  barrels 
 per  day  to  23  million  barrels,  the  fundamental  reversal  of 
 the  Middle  East  energy  flow.  On  the  contrary,  if  we  continue 
 to  strengthen  "down  the"  oil  prices  and  the  world  economic 
 relations  between  the  full  transmission,  then  all  the  countries 
 would  be  affected,  and  can  only  be  unproductive  rent-seeking 
 international  speculative  capital.

 here  on  China's  "People's  Daily"  first  published  an  article 
 entitled  "The  US  attempt  to"  cut  off  snake  heads  ""  An 
 Overview.  The  full  text  follows  :  March  31,  the  Iraqi  war 
 into  the  12th  day.  The  current  fighting  is  in  limbo.  Because 
 of  logistical  supply  lines,  and  the  army  also  much  resistance, 
 the  US  military  in  the  past  few  days  in  Baghdad  were  temporarily 
 suspended  their  advance.  After  the  redeployment,  and  the  supply 
 line  increased  security,  the  US  30  Slow  Advance  to  Baghdad 
 by  about  10  kilometres.  Meanwhile,  the  US  military  is  busy 
 implementing  its  "snake  heads  cut  off  ".  The  US  media  revealed 
 that  the  United  States  the  highest  levels  of  decision-making 
 war,  which  was  initiated  at  the  beginning  "behead  action" 
 from  three  aircraft  carrier,  fired  40  cruise  missiles,  also 
 deployed  F-117  Stealth  bombers  dropping  precision  guided  bombs, 
 killing  blow  to  Saddam  and  his  father,  "before  the  war  began 
 in  earnest  to  end  the  war  ".  Then  a  series  of  facts  have 
 proved  that  the  plan  miscalculations.  Thus,  the  Pentagon  has 
 also  established  a  "snake  heads  cut  off  ".  As  the  US  Joint 
 Chiefs  of  Staff,  Deputy  Defense  Minister  Rear  Admiral  Mike 
 Rees,  said  that  "snakes"  Iraq  is  the  senior  leadership,  "snake 
 heads"  Of  course  it  is  Saddam.  The  Pentagon  officials  still 
 focus  on  the  Iraqi  leaders,  and  acknowledged  that  the  "priority 
 for  the  removal  of  the  allied  forces  have  arrived  in  Baghdad 
 in  the  area  where  there  is  resistance  ".  The  US  military 
 planning  firmly  believe,  as  long  as  the  father  and  son  and 
 his  cronies  to  remove  Saddam  or  forced  to  step  down  or 
 cut  their  links  between  the  Iraqi  military  command  system, 
 all  of  Iraq's  resistance  forces  might  be  disintegrated.  The 
 implementation  of  the  plan  is  the  primary  means  of  bombings 
 and  assassinations.  The  US  heavy  bombardment  from  28  in  Baghdad 
 that  Saddam's  presidential  office  and  the  Arab  Baath  Socialist 
 Party  headquarters  building  and  national  communications  tower 
 in  order  to  implement  "snake  heads  cut  off  ".  At  that  time, 
 the  US  and  British  allied  ground  offensive  to  be  blocked 
 in  retaliation,  the  US  bombings  of  Iraq  further  escalation. 
 In  addition,  large  launched  cruise  missiles,  the  US  forces 
 deployed  at  the  same  time,  B-bombers,  and  air  strikes  against 
 Baghdad.  The  United  States  Central  Command  said  that  this 
 is  the  first  time  in  history  at  the  same  time  the  US  third-generation 
 Long-range  strategic  bombers  flew  to  the  same  place  for  bombing. 
 The  US  air  strikes  against  Iraq  during  the  day  of  the  national 
 telecommunications  building  and  used  for  the  first  time,  weighing 
 2,115  kilograms  of  satellite-guided  "Bunkers  nemesis  bombs" 
 and  destroyed  the  building.  The  American  media,  as  "snake 
 heads  cut  off"  part  of  the  plan,  the  allied  aircraft  has 
 been  Iraq's  TV  transmitters  as  targets,  which  was  said  to 
 be  a  leader  of  Iraq  as  well  as  command  and  control  system. 
 These  television  transmission  vehicles  was  seen  as  Saddam 
 control  of  its  troops  as  well  as  an  important  part  of  the 
 Iraqi  people.  The  result  is  that  even  ordinary  Iraqi  people 
 is  not  television,  telephone  nor  hit.  The  Pentagon  said  a 
 spokesman  for  the  30,  since  the  war,  the  US  and  British 
 forces  in  Iraq  has  been  dropped  6,000  fired  precision-guided 
 bombs  and  fired  675  missiles  "Tomahawk"  cruise-missile.  "Washington 
 Post"  in  the  29th,  revealed  the  "snake  heads  cut  off"  the 
 implementation  of  the  plan.  Reports  that  the  United  States 
 is  Iraq's  implementation  of  the  series  of  secret  assassination, 
 with  the  aim  of  the  Republican  Guard  Saddam's  prestige  and 
 high-ranking  officers,  including  the  Arab  Baath  Socialist  Party 
 and  other  key  elements  of  the  regime  of  Saddam  Hussein. 
 The  paper  also  said  that  the  United  States  Central  Intelligence 
 Agency  and  US  Special  Forces  agents  involved  in  assassinations 
 in  the  bush  to  Saddam  Hussein's  "ultimatum"  before  the  entry 
 into  Iraq.  In  the  last  few  weeks,  they  have  done  some  assassination 
 mission,  killing  several  people.  The  explosion  which  occurred 
 recently  in  Baghdad,  not  all  of  which  are  carried  out  by 
 Allied  air  strikes,  some  of  which  was  the  assassination  team 
 work.  "Washington  Post  ",  noting  that  previous  CIA  and  the 
 military  did  not  make  such  a  brazen  assassination  fixed. 
 It  seems  that  the  US  military  is  home  to  find  ways  and 
 means  to  kill  Saddam  and  then  quickly.

 Xinhua  News  Agency,  London,  March  31  (Bale-fire  line  with 
 cotton  wadding  fly)  Yellow  Ribbon  transmitting  the  voice  of 
 Xinhua  news  agency  reporter  Xu  Jianmei  Iraq  war  of  the  12th 
 day,  31  March,  three  British  soldiers  who  refuse  to  be  known 
 as  "innocent  civilians  resulting  in  death"  of  war  had  been 
 repatriated.  The  British  Royal  United  Service  Institute,  the 
 defense  experts  Michael  comments  road  Mai  Jindi:  they  "are 
 in  fact  said:"  I  am  willing  to  sacrifice  for  the  country, 
 willing  to  risk  their  lives  for  the  country;  but  in  return, 
 I  expect  my  country  is  directed  me  to  do  the  right  thing. 
 "  On  the  findings  of  an  opinion  poll:  Most  of  the  British 
 government  does  not  expect  Iraq  to  the  United  States  and 
 British  forces  as  "liberators"  (76  %),  the  Iraqi  people  will 
 no  longer  expect  rallied  against  the  government  (86  %),  no 
 longer  believe  majority  of  the  Iraqi  army  will  voluntarily 
 surrender  (74  %)  and  no  longer  believed  that  the  United 
 States  and  Britain  will  destroy  Iraq's  Resistance  Army  (89 
 %).  The  day  before,  the  British  government  and  military  support, 
 right-wing  tabloid  "News  of  the  world"  issue  "for  our  heroes, 
 on  a  Yellow  Ribbon  ".  On  the  following  day,  "the  Times" 
 raised  acute  questions:  yellow  ribbon  of  the  British  hearts 
 ?  What  meaning  can  look  at  how  the  British  forces  in  Iraq 
 ?  4  presence  in  Gulf  British  their  name,  whether  "we  need 
 the  support  of  the  war  hero  deserves  our  sympathy  ?  or 
 misfortune  The  victims  ?  "  "The  times"  since  there  is  a 
 challenge.  First,  according  to  historical  tradition,  the  British 
 people  have  always  been  flag  rather  than  wearing  yellow  silk 
 have  expressed  support  to  front-line  troops.  Iraq  since  the 
 outbreak  of  war,  but  now  it  is  difficult  to  find  a  broken 
 iron  shoes  flag  families.  Secondly,  the  United  Kingdom  and 
 the  Western  world  practices,  yellow  ribbon  and  also  has  never 
 had  any  involvement  in  war  or  heroism.  The  hostages  were 
 abducted  for  safe  return,  it  would  be  on  a  Yellow  Ribbon; 
 to  the  rehabilitation  of  children  suffering  from  leukaemia, 
 relatives  and  friends  and  neighbours  will  be  on  a  yellow 
 ribbon,  condolences  for  "9.11"  those  who  perished  in  the 
 incident,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  have  been  on  a 
 yellow  ribbon.  It  is  evident  that  yellow  ribbon  symbolizes 
 the  suffering  of  innocent  people  in  western  compatriots  placed 
 sincere  sympathy.  "News  of  the  world"  does  not  call  flag, 
 but  called  on  a  yellow  ribbon,  inadvertently  revealed  the 
 subconsciousness  contradictions  and  loss.  Every  British  Mothers' 
 Day  is  March  30.  The  newspaper  under  the  title  is  finishing 
 the  first  article:  "Mother's  Day  in  the  day,  we  pray  that 
 our  safe  return  of  the  fighters  ",  which  is  the  real  message 
 yellow  ribbon.  "The  Times"  said:  "Many  (British)  really  want 
 to  say:  '  We  support  the  army,  but  we  do  not  need  to 
 support  them  to  be  fighting  for  '  political  objectives  ". 
 The  British  people  "the  strongest  wish  is  that  the  army 
 to  return  home  safely  ".

 In  the  foreign  policy  since  World  War  II,  the  US  government 
 enemy  distinguishing  between  friends,  it  is  to  take  "anti-communist 
 and  pro-US  ",  and  is  no  way  constituted  a"  democracy  "to 
 measure.  It  is  a  well-known  fact  that  in  Latin  America, 
 the  United  States  has  military  support  to  battle  the  fire 
 practice  subversive  Allende  democratically  elected  government 
 and  long-term  support  notorious  Somoza  dictatorship  in  Asia, 
 the  United  States  was  backing  some  dictatorial  regime.  Looking 
 back  at  the  sites  Iraq  war,  the  United  States  of  hypocrisy 
 and  democracy  are  two  faces  exposed.  The  United  States  for 
 self-styled  "world's  most  democratic  country  ",  separation 
 of  powers  in  the  country,  focusing  on  rule  of  law.  To  be 
 in  sharp  contrast,  the  United  States  in  the  international 
 arena,  but  it  is  regarded  as  one  of  the  hegemonic  faces: 
 As  a  founding  member  of  the  United  Nations,  it  will  be 
 their  rising  above  the  U.N.  ignored  the  UN  Charter  should 
 not  interfere  in  internal  affairs  of  member  states,  and  asked 
 the  Council  for  the  replacement  force  other  countries  open 
 green  power.  The  two  bodies  at  a  time  when  the  United  Nations 
 Security  Council  Resolution  1441,  the  inspection  of  Iraqi 
 weapons  making  progress,  it  can  unilaterally  suspended  arrogant. 
 The  vast  majority  of  countries  to  persuade  the  council  and 
 opposed  to  the  peoples  of  the  world  that  the  surge  of  anti-war 
 voice,  the  United  States  is  totally  blind,  turning  a  deaf 
 ear,  and  insists  on  use  of  force.  Against  the  people  throughout 
 the  world  public  opinion,  disrespect  for  the  United  Nations 
 authority  and  violated  international  law  is  consistent  with 
 the  spirit  of  democracy  ?  One  Western  scholars  recently  wrote 
 an  article.  use  of  force  against  Iraq  on  the  United  States 
 made  an  image  of  the  analogy.  He  said:  The  United  States 
 just  like  the  plaintiff,  just  like  Iraq  suspects,  the  United 
 Nations  as  the  judge  or  jury.  However,  the  United  States 
 have  failed  to  produce  conclusive  evidence,  and  completion 
 of  the  criminal  investigations  against  the  judge  and  jury 
 refused  to  hear  the  views  of  Iraq's  death  sentence  and  unilateral 
 and  arbitrary  law  enforcement.  This  is  not  only  against  principles 
 of  democracy  itself  is  a  violation.  The  United  States  with 
 its  own  words  and  deeds  to  let  people  see  the  fact  that 
 the  United  States  attack  on  Iraq's  ultimate  aim  is  to  remove 
 an  anti-American  regime,  established  in  the  Middle  East  a 
 undisputed  status,  opening  the  way  for  the  establishment  of 
 a  global  hegemony.  So-called  "anti-terrorism"  and  a  "democratic" 
 and  so  on,  but  the  United  States  to  seek  hegemonism  means 
 only.

 be  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people.  However,  in  1991  in 
 the  Gulf  War,  Iraq  many  cultural  heritage  sites  and  museums 
 were  damaged.  Iraq  Ould  region  with  a  one-year-old  royal 
 tomb  from  the  4500  bombing  of  US  military  planes  were  damaged 
 and  four  on  the  ground  has  left  a  huge  crater,  more  than

 heavy  bombardment,  it  is  most  worried  about  the  sites  in 
 Iraq,  the  Taiwan-shaped  like  heritage  can  withstand  the  impact 
 of  the  earthquake.  Iraq  is  the  ancient  city  by  mud-brick 
 building,  in  their  collapse,  and  the  building  was  built  in 
 the  ruins.  After  centuries  of  accumulated,  these  territories 
 Tun,  known  as  Taiwan-shaped  sites,  desolate  flat  desert  sand

 hope  to  be  able  to  cope  with  their  hands  from  those  days 
 and  dropped  bombs  in  order  to  protect  (Iraq)  Museum  from

 (In  history  to  return  to)  the  Iraqi  side  statistics,  during 
 the  Gulf  War  and  post-war,  Iraqi  museums  and  archaeological 
 sites  and  archaeological  relics  found  there  were  2,264  products 
 as  well  as  some  20,000  precious  manuscripts  looted.  And  the 
 worst  thing  is  that  sites  were  looted,  even  to  find  the 
 missing  objects,  precious  materials  are  also  missing.  The 
 archaeologists,  the  source  of  cultural  relics,  and  its  detailed 
 source  and  the  identification  process,  and  culture  itself 
 is  equally  important.  The  Latin  American  art  historian,  said: 
 "If  you  see  something  to  study  and  stories  relating  to  it, 
 you  must  know  the  exact  source  its  understanding  of  everything 
 around  it.  An  isolated  items  can  only  be  explained  by  the 
 story  has  been  destroyed.  "  In  March  this  year,  well-known 
 of  Iraq's  National  Museum  four  doors  closed,  each  door  are 
 a  pile  up  sandbags,  when  it  can  be  re-opened  to  visitors 
 is  not  known.  Museums  valuable  even  inside  the  city  of  the 
 Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States,  sculptures,  frescoes  and 
 some  of  the  stone  inscription  cuneiform  writing  of  ancient 
 tombs  gold  and  silver  products.  (direct  attack  on  the  ground) 
 UNESCO  cultural  officials  responsible  for  the  Boucheix  Munir 
 Nike  March  27,  the  US  and  British  forces  in  the  first  week 
 of  the  attack  on  Iraq,  Baghdad,  Tikrit  and  Mosul  in  all 
 the  museums  were  damaged.  Ancient  city  of  Mosul  and  precious 
 wealth  museum  items,  including  several  centuries  before  Christ 
 sculptures,  board  and  other  artifacts.  Baghdad,  the  museum's 
 collection  of  treasures  from  the  recent  Iraqi  royal  family. 
 Some  European  and  American  academic  institutions  have  been 
 attempting  to  the  US  Defense  Department  to  allow  Iraq  to 
 recognize  the  importance  of  cultural  relics  in  the  world. 
 These  bodies  to  the  US  military  has  submitted  more  than 
 4,000  Iraqi  Cultural  Monuments  location  information  to  combat 
 against  the  military.  However,  George,  said:  "More  then  (the 
 Gulf  War)  and  the  fate  of  this  may  happen,  you  can  imagine 
 (heritage)  will  be  even  more  damage.  In  1991,  they  (US) 
 only  a  small  part  to  enter  Iraqi  territory,  but  now  they 
 want  to  seize  the  whole  country.  "  (1)  more  formidable  post-war 
 damage  "The  last  Gulf  War,  people  are  worried  about  the 
 bombing  of  bombs."  But  in  fact  cause  greater  damage  is  happening 
 in  the  post-war.  Boston  University  -  archaeologists  Paul  German 
 post-mortem  base.  (history  back  on)  prior  to  1990,  Iraq  has 
 an  enviable  cultural  heritage  protection  system.  The  severe 
 "Heritage  Law  ",  established  in  1920  management  department 
 of  antiquities  and  monuments  in  all  of  the  cultural  sites, 
 the  national  did  not  find  any  illegal  archaeological  digs 
 and  relics  smuggling  activities.  However,  the  Gulf  War,  Iraq's 
 antiquities  department  lack  of  funds,  there  was  a  serious 
 drain,  more  than  20  professional  doctorate  abroad  to  flee 
 their  homes,  leaving  three  people  remaining  in  the  country. 
 As  a  result  of  an  inability  to  pay  wages,  the  Iraqi  sites 
 of  cultural  relics  departments  have  to  dismiss  many  security 
 personnel,  and  even  Babylon,  Ninawa,  some  of  the  major  sites 
 were  also  negligent  in  custody,  theft  and  can  be  easily 
 removed  several  tonnes  of  cultural  relics,  and  smuggling  groups 
 inside  and  outside  the  collusion  between  the  phenomenon  of 
 cultural  relics  made  unauthorized  excavation  near  spread  continuously 
 losing  large  relics  illegally  entered  international  markets. 
 Now,  as  long  as  we  harbour  electronic  auction  site  in  the 
 United  States  (eBAY)  Search  "Russia  and  the  United  States," 
 or  "cuneiform  writing  ",  it  was  found  that  many  outflow 
 of  cultural  treasures  from  Iraq  are  being  sold  on  the  Internet. 
 (direct  attack  battlefield)  the  painful  lessons  of  the  Gulf 
 War,  the  Iraqi  authorities  on  this  before  the  outbreak  of 
 war  in  the  country  began  to  shift  distribution  throughout 
 the  cultural  relics,  and  with  the  United  Nations  Cultural 
 Organization  (UNESCO)  on  how  to  protect  cultural  heritage, 
 so  that  the  war  may  be  the  protection  of  cultural  heritage 
 to  minimize  the  damage  caused.  American  cultural  policy  committee 
 chairman  Ashton.  Hawkins  had  warned  the  US  State  Department 
 and  the  Ministry  of  Defence  said:  "The  Iraqi  sites,  monuments 
 and  museums  must  be  protected,  because  Iraq's  cultural  heritage

 worst  thing  is  that  sites  were  looted,  even  to  find  the 
 missing  objects,  precious  materials  are  also  missing.  In  March 
 this  year,  well-known  of  Iraq's  National  Museum  four  doors 
 closed,  each  door  are  a  pile  up  sandbags,  when  it  can  be 
 re-opened  to  visitors  is  not  known.  Museums  valuable  even 
 inside  the  city  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States, 
 sculptures,  frescoes  and  some  of  the  stone  inscription  cuneiform 
 writing  of  ancient  tombs  gold  and  silver  products.  UNESCO 
 officials  responsible  for  cultural  affairs  of  the  Boucheix 
 Munir  Nike,  March  27,  said  that  Iraq  war  in  the  first  week 
 in  Baghdad,  Tikrit  and  Mosul  in  all  the  museums  were  damaged. 
 Ancient  city  of  Mosul  and  precious  wealth  museum  items,  including 
 several  centuries  before  Christ  sculptures,  board  and  other 
 artifacts.  Baghdad,  the  museum's  collection  of  treasures  from 
 the  recent  Iraqi  royal  family.  Some  European  and  American 
 academic  institutions  have  been  attempting  to  the  US  Defense 
 Department  to  allow  Iraq  to  recognize  the  importance  of  cultural 
 relics  in  the  world.  These  bodies  to  the  US  military  has 
 submitted  more  than  4,000  Iraqi  Cultural  Monuments  location 
 information  to  combat  against  the  military.  There  is  no  doubt 
 that  war  itself  will  directly  threaten  the  security  of  Iraq's 
 cultural  monuments,  but  the  damage  suffered  by  post-war  monuments 
 even  more  alarming.  Prior  to  1990,  Iraq  has  an  enviable 
 cultural  heritage  protection  system.  The  severe  "Heritage  Law 
 ",  the  Iraqi  antiquities  department  administers  all  of  the 
 cultural  sites  and  objects,  the  national  did  not  find  any 
 illegal  archaeological  digs  and  relics  smuggling  activities. 
 However,  since  the  Gulf  War,  Iraq's  cultural  sector  owing 
 to  a  shortage  of  funds,  unable  to  pay  wages  to  dismiss 
 many  sites  security  personnel,  and  even  Babylon,  Ninawa,  some 
 of  the  major  sites  were  also  negligent  in  custody,  theft 
 and  can  be  easily  removed  several  tonnes  of  cultural  relics, 
 and  smuggling  groups  inside  and  outside  the  collusion  between 
 the  phenomenon  of  cultural  relics  made  unauthorized  excavation 
 near  spread  continuously  losing  large  relics  illegally  entered 
 international  markets.  Now,  as  long  as  we  harbour  electronic 
 auction  site  in  the  United  States  (eBAY)  Search  "Russia  and 
 the  United  States,"  or  "cuneiform  writing  ",  it  was  found 
 that  many  outflow  of  cultural  treasures  from  Iraq  are  being 
 sold  on  the  Internet.  Leaving  the  painful  lessons  of  the 
 Gulf  War,  Iraq  in  the  transfer  to  begin  before  the  outbreak 
 of  war  in  the  distribution  in  the  ruins  of  cultural  relics, 
 and  with  UNESCO  and  consultations  on  how  to  protect  cultural 
 heritage  for  the  war  may  be  the  protection  of  cultural  heritage

 the  social  security  system  is  improving.  Education  has  made 
 great  progress.  For  example,  compulsory  education  in  impoverished 
 areas  has  been  expanded.  The  Chinese  people's  illiteracy  rate 
 has  dropped  to  4.5  %,  this  is  a  tremendous  achievement. 
 China  to  promote  the  rule  of  law  as  a  priority  in  order 
 to  ensure  that  people  can  enjoy  civil  and  political  rights. 
 All  the  relevant  international  community  recognized  that  the 
 Chinese  government  in  China  the  progress  made  in  strengthening 
 the  rule  of  law.  At  the  same  time,  the  Chinese  government 
 to  ensure  that  the  autonomous  region  have  enjoyed  equal  rights 
 to  ethnic  minorities  have  made  great  efforts.  In  addition, 
 the  government  in  minority  areas  poverty  alleviation.  The 
 freedom  of  religious  belief  and  religious  activities  are  fully 
 protected.  These  areas  have  also  developed  its  own  laws  and 
 regulations  on  family  planning.  In  short,  it  can  be  said 
 that  modern  China's  achievements,  reform  and  opening  up  the 
 human  rights  and  unprecedented  positive  developments  have  given 
 me  a  deep  impression.  Wish  this  friendly  countries  and  people 
 greater  achievements,  particularly  in  2020  to  a  well-off  society. 
 The  Indonesian  ambassador  to  China  Mr.  Coustilla:  human  rights 
 situation  in  most  developing  countries  have  made  progress, 
 especially  China,  in  the  past  few  years  has  been  so  rapid 
 economic  development.  The  Chinese  people  enjoy  the  people 
 of  developed  countries  the  enjoyment  of  human  rights.  As 
 long  as  complying  with  national  laws  and  regulations,  the 
 Chinese  people  have  the  freedom  to  any  place,  want  to  do 
 any  freedom.  Hungarian  ambassador  to  China  that  Mr.  Bai  Mingyi: 
 In  the  past  few  decades,  China's  human  rights  situation  has 
 changed  dramatically.  Since  the  1978  law  reform,  China's  law 
 a  significant  increase  in  quantity,  quality  has  been  further 
 improved.  "Cultural  Revolution"  following  the  end  of  a  quarter 
 century,  China's  history  is  the  most  dedicated  efforts  to 
 build  the  rule  of  law.  The  fruitful  outcome  of  the  whole 
 society  in  China  benefit  from  it.  Hungary  noted  that  China 
 in  this  effort  is  very  support  such  efforts.  Hungary  is 
 ready  to  share  in  the  past  10  years  China  to  democracy, 
 rule  of  law  and  a  market  economy  in  transition  experience. 
 China  and  Hungary,  two  traditional  friends  of  the  modern 
 history  of  the  challenges  in  the  past  have  much  in  common. 
 This  is  why  our  two  countries  in  the  cause  of  human  rights 
 dialogue  initiated  in  2000.  We  believe  that  open  and  constructive 
 exchange  with  the  Chinese  human  rights  issues  beneficial  to 
 both  countries.  Hungary's  experience  has  shown  that  well-functioning 
 market  economy  and  the  rule  of  law  are  closely  linked,  because 
 only  in  an  orderly  market  mechanism  and  reliable  legal  environment. 
 "I  believe  that  China  is  moving  to  maximize  the  use  of 
 these  ideas,  although  its  historical  and  cultural  background 
 and  Hungary  are  varied.  Mexico  in  the  Chinese  minister  Jose 
 Maria  Olamas  Mr.  Cardenas  said:  China  and  Mexico  on  the 
 issue  of  human  rights  have  the  same  constructive  stance, 
 and  expressed  the  hope  that  in  promoting  actively  support 
 the  protection  and  promotion  of  human  rights  to  find  more 
 ways  of  cooperation.  September  2001,  the  Minister  of  State 
 for  Human  Rights  Mexico  Marie  Claire.  Acosta's  visit  to  China, 
 and  Chinese  officials  and  human  rights  organizations  have 
 carried  out  a  series  of  fruitful  talks.  Such  a  dialogue 
 we  have  identified  as  priority.  During  his  visit  to  Mexico 
 to  China  in  protecting  and  promoting  people's  rights  to  subsistence 
 and  development,  protection  of  minorities  and  giving  them 
 broad  autonomy,  freedom  of  religious  belief,  the  progress 
 achieved  left  a  deep  impression.  As  a  developing  country, 
 both  held  that  human  rights  should  not  be  used  as  interference 
 in  internal  affairs  under  the  pretext  of  any  country.  We 
 are  fully  aware  that  China  is  building  a  well-off  society 
 has  made  unremitting  efforts,  including  the  Chinese  Communist 
 Party  of  the  16th  Party  congress  further  economic  development 
 and  improve  democracy,  development  of  science  and  technology, 
 culture,  promote  social  harmony,  and  improving  the  people's 
 living  standards,  the  rule  of  law  and  the  rule  of  virtue.

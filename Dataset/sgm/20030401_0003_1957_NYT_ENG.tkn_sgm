NEW YORO B lJdrhPR\N@FPB\NJH@L^d@hPJ@Jhf@nPJ\@hPJr@hdBHJH@L^dRVJ@ 
RBttB@HjdR\N@hPJ@brrp@fJBf^\\@ RBttB@BXZ^fh@fRngle-handedly transformed 
the Mets from a backwater franchise into a contender. The Mets made 
the playoffs in 1999 and the World Series the next year. But the Mets 
missed the playoffs the past two years and fired their manager, Bobby 
Valentine. Now, with a new manager, Art Howe, and several new players, 
the Mets expect to return to the postseason. When they signed Piazza 
to a seven-year contract after the 1998 season, the Mets set a time 
frame to win a championship in the prime of his career. But time is 
running out. ``We've only been to the World Series one time with him,'' 
Fred Wilpon, the Mets' owner, said last week. ``We need to be there 
more. That's the goal.''&lt; Wilpon has emphasized a family atmosphere 
since he bought out Nelson Doubleday to become the principal owner 
last August and his son, Jeff, assumed greater responsibility as the 
Mets' chief operating officer. But Wilpon is also a driven competitor, 
and his decision to fire Valentine after last season proved that his 
patience was finite. Howe has the security of a four-year contract 
but a team owner who is more involved than ever. General Manager Steve 
Phillips built two playoff teams around Piazza and has surrounded 
him with established veterans at most positions. But the outfield 
has questions, half the lineup hinges on players rebounding from their 
worst seasons and the pitching rotation had two openings entering 
the final week of spring training. Perhaps most glaring, Piazza's 
batting average has dropped the past two years, dipping below .300 
for the first time last year. He turns 35 in September, past the age 
at which most catchers look to ease the burden on their bodies. But 
Phillips still believes in Piazza. ``I have no thought or expectation 
that he won't get back to the numbers that he's produced in the past,'' 
Phillips said. ``None of those other catchers are Mike Piazza. Comparing 
him to what happens to other catchers just isn't apples to apples.'' 
During spring training, Howe put off any thought of a position switch 
for Piazza. But regardless of where he plays, Piazza can carry a team 
for only so long. He has three years left on his contract, and Piazza 
views this season as a turning point for the Mets. The team has six 
primary players whose contracts will expire after the season, including 
Roberto Alomar, Jeromy Burnitz, Pedro Astacio and Armando Benitez. 
``There's obviously a lot of guys who could change and we could be 
very different,'' Piazza said. As proof of their intent to win now, 
the Mets' off-season centered on adding more veterans like pitchers 
Tom Glavine and Mike Stanton. Phillips preaches the correlation between 
experience let the free-agent third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo leave 
without making him an offer and funneled that money to the often-injured 
left fielder Cliff Floyd. Unable to sign another third baseman, they 
handed the position to the rookie Ty Wigginton. They ehtended their 
budget to add Glavine to an aging rotation. ``It's not just Mike and 
the years he's caught,'' starter Al Leiter said. ``Look at the age 
of all the guys on the team. It's not any type of secret this team 
is built to win now. We're absolutely built to go to a World Series. 
We have guys that have done it.'' (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL 
FOLLOWS.) The Mets entered camp with the third-oldest 40-man roster 
in the major leagues, behind the Cardinals and the Yankees. The average 
age of 28.675 did not factor in Graeme Lloyd (35) and Jay Bell (37), 
who made the opening day roster, or Tony Clark (30), who should join 
the team within a week. Of the eight position players, only Wigginton 
(25), Roger Cedeno (28) and Floyd (30) are younger than 33. In the 
projected rotation are Glavine (37), Leiter (37), Steve Trachsel (32), 
David Cone (40) and the injured Astacio (33). Leiter understands that 
age increases risk, but he also realizes youth can be fragile. ``I 
had my first shoulder operation when I was a 23-year-old,'' he said. 
``My second one, I was almost 25. I see a lot of young kids around 
here rehabbing their shoulders and elbows. I also know that my last 
seven years have been absolutely the best of my career.'' Leiter's 
point is clear: veterans have learned how to succeed and stay in shape. 
And Wilpon believes most of the Mets' core players should have three 
to four more prime years. ``But the fact is we blended that with young 
players and will continue to blend because our system is starting 
to produce,'' he said. ``I think it's obvious our system was dormant 
for too long.'' Wigginton, a product of that system, will start at 
third base with Bell as a safety net. Prospects like shortstop Jose 
Reyes and pitcher Aaron Heilman are expected to contribute at some 
point this season. Glavine, who was courted by Wilpon during the off-season, 
needs 58 victories to reach 300. Wilpon vowed that he would provide 
Glavine with a competitive team for the length of the three-year, 
$35 million contract he signed in December. ``I'm not going to play 
forever, and I'm certainly on the back end of my career, so the opportunities 
for me are going to get fewer no matter what,'' Glavine said. ``That's 
just a reality for me that my chances are going to start diminishing, 
but I don't think you look at it in terms of, `Oh, geez, I only have 
four more chances,' because who knows.'' Another New York team was 
built around a franchise player. For 15 seasons, the Knicks tried 
to surround Patrick Ewing with a cast that could win a championship, 
but they never won a title. When Ewing finally left, the Knicks crumbled. 
Piazza views his situqt)gn as different from Ewing's. ``I'm proud 
of the position I've had in this organization, but I don't look at 
it that way,'' Piazza said. ``Baseball is a team sport, an extended-team 
sport. That was pretty obvious when we went to the World Series. There's 
not one player that's going to shape the destiny of an organization.'' 
But Piazza, who is as skilled at deflecting attention as he is at 
swatting a baseball, has changed the course of the Mets franchise. 
The pressure to win with him has increased every year since his arrival 
five years ago.

Bob Knight's Red Raiders, Connecticut, Georgia Tech and Utah will 
headline a field of 16 tea-s Hn the NIT Preseason tournament. Folaying. 
They'll remember this trip. For many of the players, it will be their 
first trip to New York City and maybe their only chance to play inside 
legendary Madison Square Garden. They'll also remember that they never 
want to play there again in April. ``Yeah, I'd rather go to the NCAA,'' 
Tech senior`KaRib Powell said as the team left for the Big Apple. 
``But, we're giving it 110 percent.'' What all four semifinalists 
have in common are dashed hopes and a season that fell below expectations. 
Yet all four have managed to subdue their disappointment to compete 
for a consolation championship. Tech (21-12) enters its semifinal 
game against St. John's (19-13) as a one-point favorite. Minnesota 
(18i1" , which Tech beat earlier this season, plays Georgetown (18-14) 
in the other semifinal. The final is at 7 p.m. Thursday. ``If you 
kept track of the teams the No. 1- and 2-seeded teams \Rin the NCAA 
Tournament\S play in the first two rounds, you'll find that very few 
of them, if any, would be as good as maybe 20 teams in the NIT,'' 
said Knight, who makes his first trip to New York for the NIT semifinals 
since 1985. ``That's what makes the NIT so worthwhile because there's 
a lot of good competition in it.'' There is something to be said for 
that. The Big East complained that only four of its teams made it 
to the NCAA Tournament. Syracuse is in the Final Four and Georgetown 
and St. John's have rolled through three victories each in the NIT. 
Texas Tech, while playing itself onto the NCAA bubble, still received 
some support for an NCAA bid because of the competitiveness of the 
Big 12O Conference, which has two teams in the NCAA Final Four. And 
Tech beat one of them, Texas, in the Big 12 tournament. ``What we 
benefit mostly from \Rby playing in the NIT\S,'' Knight said, ``is 
that when we play as best as we can, we know that we are one hard 
to team to play against.'' Still, returning players such as Andre 
Emmett will remember defeating Texas and playing Oklahoma tough a 
lot more than winning an NIT championship. Tech has faced lighter 
competition than it does most nights in its own conference. Nevada 
and San Diego State are teams Tech would schedule for a decent nonconference 
game. They played at San Diego State and won this season. Tech is 
the favorite to win the NIT. It enters the semifinals with an Ratings 
Percentage Index of 48, the best of the final four teams. The RPI 
ranks teams through a combination of statistics such as home and road 
records, quality victories and strength of schedule. It is one tool 
the NCAA Tournament selection committee uses to decide its field of 
65. St. John's RPI is 78. Minnesota is 71 and Georgetown is 100. Any 
of the four would likely have a more difficult time winning the NIT 
preseason tournament than this one. But, Knight said, that's not really 
the point. ``The NIT,'' Knight said, ``is a great alternative to continue 
to work at things.'' Each of Knight's three Indiana teams that played 
in the NIT returned to the NCAA Tournament the next season. nn

The demolition crew came under the cover of night to carve up the 
runway of the little lakefront airport that ha of downtown, wanted 
it transformed into a picturesque lakeside park. Friends of Meigs 
Field, a collection of businessmen and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots 
Association, had long fought the closing of the tiny airport, contending 
that it was a vital link for business commuters. The fate of Meigs 
Field had seemed more secure since an agreement reached in December 
2001 by Daley and George Ryan, who was then the governor, to keep 
it open until 2026 under a plan to expand O'Hare International Airport. 
But that deal is apparently stalled in Congress, if not altogether 
dead at the federal level, because of opposition to the expansion 
of O'Hare. Daley now deems the closing of Meigs Field to be a matter 
of domestic security, and he ordered the bulldozers in. Unannounced 
to the public, city workers moved in overnight _ even as private planes 
sat parked along the runway _ and started digging. So as the sun rose 
on Monday morning, broken chunks of concrete carved in the shape of 
X's along the length of the runway marked where workers had set about 
destroying Meigs Field. At a news conference on Monday, Daley said 
closing the airport ``will make Chicago a safer city.'' ``There hqr`neen 
no specific threat,'' he said. ``As mayor of the city of Chicago, 
public safety is one of my primary responsibilities. I take it very 
seriously.'' After the Sept. 11 attacks, Daley closed Meigs Field 
for several weeks. On Monday he said, ``I am not willing to wait for 
a tragedy, as some have asked me to do, to happen before making a 
very difficult and tough decision.'' While it was not clear how the 
16 small planes parked on Monday at Meigs Field would be removed, 
Daley said the city would reimburse the planes' owners for their expenses 
in removing them. The airport is owned by the Chicago Park District. 
The surprise shutdown of the airport, which was operating last weekend, 
set off protests from those who awoke to find the city's lone downtown 
airport with its wings clipped. ``The City of Chicago today used surprise 
and shock tactics to start demolishing Meigs Field, the world-renowned 
airport serving downtown, ripping up runway without notice in the 
dark of night under police guard,'' Friends of Meigs Field announced 
on its Web site. The organization estimates that the tiny airport 
handles 30,000 to 40,000 private flights a year. (STORY CAN END HERE 
_ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for Aircraft 
Owners and Pilots Association, said: ``We were absolutely shocked 
and dismayed. We can think of no compelling reason for closing this 
airport. If there was a real concern here, why did they have to sneak 
in like a thief in the night?'' In fact, opponents of the closure 
contended that Meigs was a safeguard against possible terrorism. ``By 
closing the airport, the mayor has also closed the control tower. 
When aircraft were flying in the vicinity of Meigs Field they had 
4o Bontact air traffic control; now they don't,'' said Morningstar, 
who says that the small aircraft that fly in and out of Meigs pose 
little potential threat. Because of the the runway length and its 
weight-bearing capability only small general aviation aircraft can 
use the field, he said, adding, ``They're incapable of doing damage 
to major structures.'' At the mayor's behest, federal authorities 
nearly two weeks ago imposed temporary flight restrictions over the 
downtown area. But that action, the mayor said Monday, ``does not 
address the problem that occurs every day as aircraft approach Meigs 
Field, within a few hundred yards and only a few seconds' flight time 
of our tallest buildings.'' Northerly Ksd`nd, where the airport is 
located, was formed from a landfill in the 1920s. /24oaring into blue 
skies over the waters of Lake Michigan. Congressional approval of 
a $6.6 billion O'Hare expansion plan which calls for Meigs to remain 
open until 2026, reached by Ryan and Daley, appears unlikely. Sen. 
Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., has vowed to launch a filibuster to block 
approval of the bill that would prevent future Illinois governors 
from using state law to block expansion. A spokeswoman for the mayor 
said on Monday that Daley had no immediate plans for the land. On 
Monday afternoon, with more than a dozen airplanes stranded at the 
airport, supporters vowed to keep fighting. ``We are still working 
to save Meigs Field,'' said Rachel Goodstein, president of the Friends 
of Meigs Field. ``I don't know that the mayor will really get away 
with this.'' But even some of the staunchest of supporters of the 
airport admit that with Meigs' lone runway in ruins, their hopes are 
slim. ``The mayor closed the airport because he could, and there is 
probably not an awful lot that anyone can do about that,'' said Morningstar.

Lawyers for American Airlines were minutes away from filing Chapter 
11 bankruptcy papers in a New York courthouse Monday afternoon when 
pilots averted the crisis by agreeing to a concessions deal. The last-minute 
vote capped a dramatic two-day marathon of nonstop bargaining in which 
leaders of the pilots, flight attendants and mechanics unions hammered 
out deals with airline executives to meet the company's own deadline. 
Combined, the three unions agreed to give up $1.6 billion through 
salary and benefit cuts as well as layoffs, in hopes that the savings 
will keep the world's largest airline financially aloft. The givebacks 
will deeply affect Fort Worth-based American's 70,000 unionized workers. 
Salaries will be cut, benefits will be slashed, employees will work 
longer hours, and hundreds will lose their jobs. Still, many employees 
said they were relieved that for the moment the deals appeared to 
have staved o0 million under Chapter 11, and closely guarded pension 
plans could fall prey to the cuts. Negotiators worked around the clock 
and had been in nonstop talks at the company's pilot training center 
for more than 30 hours by Monday afternoon. Union officials described 
hours of frenzied debate among exhausted negotiators and labor leaders. 
Mechanics and flight attendants announced tentative agreements shortly 
after noon, and employees and airline officials expected a similar 
deal from pilots. Reporters and television crews assembled at the 
union's headquarters waiting for news of an agreement. But behind 
the scenes, board members argued over the proposed concessions package. 
Many of the provisions weren't written down, yet, and there was some 
confusion about the contents of the package, said Sam Mayer, a union 
board member. The pilots final vote came only after John Darrah, president 
of the Allied Pilots Association, called board members to tell them 
that American's lawyers had arrived at the courthouse in New York 
prepared to file, Mayer said. ``We literally had John on the speakerphone, 
screaming at us that we had to make a decision because the lawyers 
were walking up the courthouse steps,'' Mayer said. At the same time, 
American's board of directors had convened for their second telephone 
conference of the afternoon, prepared to approve a bankruptcy filing. 
``We came within minutes _ hours certainly _ of having to file,'' 
said Armando Codina, a Florida developer and member of American's 
board. Minutes before a filing, at about 5 p.m., the pilots board 
voted 12-6 to approve the deal, said Mayer, who voted against the 
package. Mayer cited moves by American Chief Executive Don Carty in- 
pbessing the issue. ``Carty kept upping the ante until basically a 
majority of the board said, `I don't care what I have to give them, 
we'll do whatever it takes to stay out of bankruptcy,' '' he said. 
In a statement, Carty said the concessions ``have enabled us to avoid 
an immediate filing with the bankruptcy court.'' He also said that 
he would take a 33 percent cut in his base pay, would receive no bonus 
this year and would ask the airline's board to significantly reduce 
the fmpensation packages for him and other senior officers. Employees 
will also get a new stock option and profit-sharing program, Carty 
said. But he warned that the airline still needs to wrest savings 
from its vendors, lessors and suppliers if it wants to survive. ``The 
financial condition of American is weak, and its prospects remain 
uncertain,'' he said. American officials declined to comment beyond 
Carty's prepared statement. The negotiated packages still must be 
approved by union members, which could take two weeks. Union leaders 
said they were preparing ``road shows'' to describe the cuts and sell 
the plans to employees. (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services

A recent change in federal airspace rules restricts banner-towing 
planes like his from flying near open-air venues with at least 30,000 
seats an hour before and after an event. Williams, 35, made $12,000 
towing banners over Minute Maid Park and the Ballpark at Arlington 
on Major League Baseball's opening day last year. Standing in a hangar 
on a country road in Brazoria County, surrounded by plane parts and 
7-foot-tall letters made of red sailcloth, he said he doesn't expect 
to make anything off the Astros' opening day today. ``My rush-hour 
business pays the bills, but to make money I need events,'' said Williams, 
a native Houstonian and one of a handful of aerial advertisers in 
Texas. Slipped into a 4,200-page congressional spending bill, the 
restrictive flight rule was passed for national security reasons related 
to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Sports leagues, universities and others 
lobbied Congress for the change, which keeps the lightweight, fabric-covered 
planes at least 3,000 feet in the air and 3.45 miles from large venues. 
A banner-towing plane weighs about the same as a couple of Harley-Davidson 
motorcycles. Aerial advertisers are up in arms because they go through 
FBI background checks before they may tow banners, and the Federal 
Aviation Administration waiver system they have flown under since 
9/11 requires them to file information on their planes and where they 
plan to fly them. Pilots say it's crippling their business and putting 
public airspace into the hands of greedy sports teams and colleges 
that don't want anyone else making revenue off their events. A Houston 
Texans spokeswoman referred all calls to Reliant Park officials. ``We 
favor anything that makes the facility more secure, and apparently 
that was the intent of the legislation,'' said Nina Jackson, Reliant 
Park spokeswoman. Rob Matwick, Astros senior vice president of operations, 
doesn't have a strong opinion about banner-towing planes. He doesn't 
consider the aerial advertisers a nuisance, but he supports the new 
no-fly provision, which will be in effect for at least a year. The 
rule allows regular commercial flights, approved by air traffic controllers, 
to operate inside the no-fly zones, as well as blimps and flights 
for official broadcast purposes, and planes carrying team officials 
and players and their immediate family members and guests. Pilots 
aren't the onlyth the rule. ``It's an overreaction,'' said Carl Reister, 
62, of Pasadena. ``The terrorists are winning. How many things in 
our lives have changed since 9/11?'' Banner-towing planes are ``part 
of Americana,'' Reister said. Nowadays, thrsonal messages of the ``Marry 
Me, Margaret'' variety. `ThD U.S. Aerial Advertisers Association says 
there are more than 200 banner-towing companies nationwide with more 
than a thousand aircraft. It's a $250-million-a-year industry, Williams 
said. Last year, he made $640,000 a month, the lion's share of which 
came from advertising generated by sports games. ``I'm doing about 
$30,000 a month now,'' he said. Williams said aerial advertisers were 
grounded for four months after 9/11. Before the attacks, he had 20 
employees. Now he has eight pilots and mechanics. ``After this, who 
knows; maybe they'll just be three,'' he said. XXX END OF STORY $$$

The First Data Corp., a leading processor of credit card transactions 
and the owner of Western Union, is nearing a deal t/ @cquire Concord 
EFS Inc., which operates a large network of automated teller machines, 
for slightly more than $7 billion, executives close to the negotiations 
said Monday. The companies are hoping to complete the deal this week, 
though the executives stressed that several issues still need to be 
resolved and that the transaction could collapse. Under terms b closing 
price Monday. The deal would consolidate much of the nation's financial 
activity in First Data, which suffered a blow recently when Bank One 
said it would take its card processing business elsewhere. Executives 
close to the transaction said that the combination would create ``hundreds 
of millions of dollars in annual savings'' as behind-the-scenes costs 
are eliminated and processing charges fall. Pressure has been mounting 
on Concord EFS, which also provides electronic transaction authorization, 
to complete a deal since word spread earlier last month that the company 
had put itself up for sale. This caused some investors to worry that 
Concord could be selling itself because it might lose its all-important 
bank network contracts. Concord EFS is renegotiating its contracts, 
which are set to expire next year, with Wells Fargo and with Bank 
One for its Star Systems automated teller machine and debit-card network. 
First Data emerged the front-runner for Concord EFS after outbidding 
Automatic Data Processing Inc., a big issuer of paychecks, last week, 
the executives said. A spokeswoman for First Data said, ``We don't 
speculate on market rumors.'' A spokesman for Concord EFS coul&amp; 
not be reached. Competition for card transactions has been fierce 
as Concord, First Data and Visa USA, which operates a network for 
debit cards called Interlink, have all lowered the fees they charge 
to banks and stores to process customer purchases in an effort to 
gain market share. Shares of Concord EFS have been hit hard by the 
concern about its future and whether it could lose business to Visa's 
Interlink network. Shares of Concord EFS fell 28 cents, to $9.40 Monday. 
The stock has fallen from a 52-week high of $35.06. Shares of First 
Data rose 29 cents, to $37.01. Concord EFS restated its earnings last 
week, adjusting the way it accounted for its interchange fee for debit 
card transactions, after the Securities and Exchange Commission requested 
an accounting change. The change resulted in a reduction in revenue 
offset by a reduction in cost of operations, and, therefore, had no 
effect on reported operating income, net income or cash flows for 
any annual or quarterly period. But the accounting change did raise 
overall margins.&lt; &lt; &lt;

The Transportation Department gave its approval Monday to a marketing 
partnership among Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Northwest 
Airlines after the carriers proposed a compromise intended to make 
the arrangement more competitive. The agreement, which is called a 
code-sharing alliance, would be the largest such arrangement in the 
industry. Code-sharing alliances allow airlines to sell tickets on 
one another's flights, and let passengers use the other airlines' 
airport lounges. Passengers can select which carrier's frequent-flier 
program to use. The Transportation Department expressed concerns about 
the agreement among the three carriers when it was proposed last summer, 
warning that the linking of the airlines might reduce competition 
in the indurtv=*42049647296434:6464:36434:9:7772077:42994:19470723379::7897:21 
::424r turf, thus preventing passengers from obtaining reasonable 
air fares, the agency said. That fear was based on the airlines' control 
of 35 percent of industry revenue, as measured in passenger miles, 
and their more than 3,000 overlapping flights. United Airlines and 
US Airways have their own code-sharing agreement, which took effect 
earlier this year, but the department said it was less of a threat 
because the airlines control just 23 percent of industry revenue and 
had only 544 overlapping flights. In January, the Transportation Department 
said it would approve the three-way code-sharing arrangement if the 
airlines would modify their plans to reduce the amount of sharing 
in the initial years and forfeit certain gates. The airlines countered 
that the restrictions suggested by the department were too tight. 
They vowed to go ahead with the arrangement anyway, which could have 
forced the Transportation Department to sue them to block the marketing 
agreement. But the airlines recently came forward with some alternative 
suggestions, which the government adopted Monday. Under the modified 
plan, the three airlines will limit the flights on which they share 
information to 2,600 in the first year, or slightly less than 900 
per pair of airlines. The Transportation Department had originally 
proposed that the carriers be allowed to share information on only 
about 650 per pairing. The department also agreed that the airlines 
could share information on 5,200 flights in the second year, or about 
1,700 per pairing. The airlines also agreed to give up gates at La 
Guardia Airport and at Logan Airport in Boston, at the request of 
the airports' governing bodies, so that other competitors could claim 
them. The three airlines have said that the plan will generate $475 
million in annual revenue, by streamlining their operations and making 
it easier for passengers to choose flights. But Kevin Mitchell, president 
of the Business Travel Coalition, which represents corporate travel 
departments and business travelers, said the new arrangement might 
not yield that much for the carriers given the dismal conditions the 
industry faces. ``Any time you make a public policy decision at the 
bottom of an industry cycle, you run the risk of oveznookamage the 
operations of low-fare carriers like Southwest and JetBlue, which 
do not have similar deals. ``The three of these guys being able to 
team up and leverage their assets is a threat'' to the smaller carriers, 
Mitchell said.

Nets' hit men take down Rockets (For use by New York Times News Service 
clients)&lt; By JONATHAN FEIGEN^&lt; @c. 2003, Houston Chronicle= 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The rest of the Rockets had already collapsed. 
They were crawling around bloody and groggy, showing only passing 
interest in the whole affair. With the season and last chances to 
earn a playoff spot slipping away, the Rockets ran headlong and full 
speed into the veteran wall Monday night. They did not get up. The 
rookie, however, was fine. But to make sure Ya/ MHng left feeling 
just as defeated as his quick-to-surrender teammates, Nets center 
Dikembe Mutombo delivered a hard elbow to Yao's throat to make sure 
the pain of a 110-86 loss was shared. There was plenty of pain to 
go around. Steve Francis blamed the Rockets' disinterested defense 
on disinterested teammates. Eddie Griffin blamed it on a carry-over 
from a selfish offense. James Posey said the defensive breakdown began 
with frustration in a misfiring offense. But whatever the cause, even 
the sight of Mutombo popping Yao in the throat failed to rev the Rockets' 
engines. ``It was a lackluster performance on our part,'' Rockets 
acting head coach Larry Smith said. ``I thought we were ready for 
these guys. Tonight everything was pretty much easy for them.'' The 
Nets' only problem was stopping Yao. He had thoroughly reversed his 
recent shooting struggles and was 14 points into his 18-point first 
half when Mutombo laid him out 70 seconds before halftime. But with 
that one swing, Mutombo showed more interest in defense than the Rockets 
would the entire night. ``The center I went up against today gave 
me a very deep impression,'' Yao s1447:27:477066&lt; speaking in puns 
in two languages. ``I think his face is a little bit cuter than his 
elbow. Even if it was intentional, it happened. He was penalized for 
it. I got my two shots.'' Yao finished with 24 points, making eight 
of 11 shots. He spun swiftly away from double teams and even flashed 
one rim-swinging slam. ``In a couple of years,'' Nets forward Richard 
Jefferson said, ``he's going to be the best player in the game.'' 
But the bulk of Rockets veterans, theoretically gearing up for a finishing 
kick through the end of the season, were, as the 20,049 locals in 
Continental Airlines Arena might say, ``a dud, all stuck in the mud 
somewhere in the swamps of Jersey.'' ``It seemed like guys were running 
in quicksand tonight,'' said Francis, who had 22 points, six rebounds 
and five assists. ``The only thing I was a little upset about was 
the way they did it celebrating. We thumped them at our home. We didn't 
do all that celebrating or running plays with a minute left. That's 
something right there that will stick in the back of my head the next 
time we play the New Jersey Nets.'' But Francis' frustration was not 
focused solely on the Nets' happiness, Mutombo's elbow, the flagrant-1 
foul called on Kelvin Cato or fallaid. ``I don't think 11 out of the 
11 guys that suited up (Cuttino Mobley was sidelined with a sprained 
left index finger) were prepared to play tonight. ``It's not on our 
coach at all. If a player wants to make a scapegoat out of the coach, 
they're just trying to look out for themselves. It's not the coach 
one bit. Players know who they are who weren't putting everything 
into it. If we don't get that solved, we'll sing the same sad song 
in three weeks.'' However, the Rockets didn't have to wait for the 
end of the regular season to return to a familiar refrain. ``We didn't 
play team basketball,'' said Griffin, who made two of nine shots in 
scoring seven points. ``That's why we lost by so much. We weren't 
playing team basketball and trusting each other. Guys got frustrated 
and didn't play good defense. ``I don't think it was anything they 
did. I think we shot ourselves out of the game by trying to do too 
much one-on-one basketball and not trusting each other.'' Whatever 
the cause of the problem, it was most obvious on the defensive end, 
where the Rockets were repeatedly outrun by the Nets (Rockets coaches 
had New Jersey with 34 fast-break points), who could easily curl around 
screens for the most open of shots. With Kenyon Martin out with a 
sprained right knee, Jefferson toyed with t*e Rockets' frontcourt. 
Acquired with one of the first-round picks the Rockets sent New Jersey 
for Griffin, Jefferson hadb30 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. 
Jason Kidd _ left so open he uncharacteristically took 23 shots, making 
12 _ added 30 points and 12 rebounds as the Nets pushed their lead 
to 30. Mutombo, in his second game since coming off the injured list, 
had"fgtr points, eight rebounds and one knockdown in 16 minutes. Asked 
if it is possible to hit a 7-5 center in the throat by accident, Cato 
said, ``Hell no,'' and then walked away. ``The guy is 7-6,'' Mutombo 
said. ``He's almost three inches taller than me. I can't believe my 
elbow reached his neck. I thought maybe I would just get it between 
his chest and stomach, and I would box him out. The next thing I know, 
he's on the floor. ``I told him, `Get up.' '' Yao did. The bulk of 
the Rockets, however, meekly took whatever the Nets delivered. $$$

TIPS FOR TEENS(a)&lt; (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a)&lt; 
By DAWN GILBERTSON(a)= c.2003 The Arizona Republic(a)= (PHOENIX) - 
Students searching for a summer job will find stiff competition this 
year because of the weak economy. Here are suggestions, from Communities 
in Schools in Arizona, on how to approach the hunt. Tell everybody 
you know or meet you're looking for a job. They might have a lead 
or a position. Put together a folder highlighting your accomplishments, 
from awards to volunteer activities, and any skills specific to the 
job. The effort will show the employer you're serious. Visit three 
businesses in your neighborhood and ask about any opportunities. Nag, 
nag, nag. After you fill out an application or have an interview, 
be persistent about following up. Communities in Schools of Arizona 
has scheduled workshops for teens from 5 to 7 p.m. Wednesday and April 
23 at Desert Sage Library, 7602 W. Encanto Blvd. The group also is 
organizing three teen job fairs this spring. Details: (602) 252-5312.

ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS MAY BURN HOLES IN BUSH'S `ROAD MAP'@ ATTENTION 
EDITORS: This article from the NEWHOUSE NEWS SERVICE report of MONDAY, 
MARCH 31, 2003, is available as a `separate buy.' For inforoation 
acoutded(at)nytimes.com@ Optional trim to 900 words@ By REBECCA GOLDSMITH@ 
c.2003 Newhouse News Service@ SHILO, West Bank _ The so-called Middle 
East ``road map'' promised by President Bush is essentially a plan 
to create a Palestinian state by 2005 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
where some 200,000 Jewish settlers live despite U.N. resolutions designating 
the areas a Palestinian homeland. West Bank and Gaza also are home 
to about 2 million Palestinians. The difficulty of divvying up the 
West Bank is just one of the seemingly intractable obstacles to peace 
that help explain why many Israelis and Palestinians say they feel 
hopeless about the future. ``There is an expectation that some people 
have that, miraculously, after the United States deals with Iraq, 
there's going to be a new Middle East; (they) ... are hoping for something 
that will extricate the Israelis and Palestinians from their political 
situation,'' said Asher Susser, director of the Moshe Dayan Center 
for Middle Eastern Studies at Tel Aviv University. But, Susser said, 
``The kinds of issues that separate Israelis and Palestinians are 
still going to be there even when the United States finishes (in Iraq). 
They won't be any easier to resolve.'' Doubts about a resolution afflict 
even some of the conservatives who subscribe to the ``domino theory'' 
that sees regime change in Iraq eradicating terrorism and spreading 
democracy throughout Arab states. Yuri Shtern, a member of Israel's 
parliament and chairman of the conservative National Union-Israel 
Beitenu faction within it, said the establishment of a Palestinian 
state of any kind would negate any gains from ousting Saddam Hussein 
in Iraq. ``The Palestinian state would only be the state of terror,'' 
Shtern said. Instead, he called for ``resettlement'' of Palestinians 
living in refugee camps to better living conditions in Arab-run countries. 
He said funding for his plan ``should be an international problem,'' 
not Israel's. While Israelis battle it out among themselves, Palestinian 
leaders are pushing for a speedy publication of the road map plan. 
Bush had promised to present his plan when Palestinians appointed 
a prime minister. Mahmoud Abbas has been named to the post, but Israeli 
Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom has said Israel won't be ready to open 
negotiations with the Palestinians until Abbas shows he has control 
on the ground and prevents terror activities. ``I don't think that 
we have to wait for the war to end to begin a peace process,'' said 
Saeb Erekat, chief negotiator for the Palestinians. ``The road map 
should have been introduced a long time ago, and any day we delay, 
I think, is a mistake.'' Meanwhile, Israelis in settlements like Shilo 
_ a West Bank community of 200 families surrounded by Arab villages, 
some 180 miles north of Jerusalem _ are digging in their heels. ``We're 
not going anywhere; this is our home,'' said Sara Katz, a 44-year-old 
mother of eight and the wife of Shilo's mayor, Chaim. Tenacity is 
a way of life here. Shilo began as an outpost 25 years ago with a 
few temporary structures, no paved roads and no running water. Now 
it has its own schools and a perimeter patrolled by gunmen around 
the clock. Lisa and David Rubin, who came here from the United States, 
live with their six children behind a white picket fence. A barbecue 
is in the back yard. The five older children run freely through their 
neighborhood. But their lives are far from carefree. In December 2001, 
David Rubin, 46, and son Ruby, then 3, were shot while David was driving 
near another settlement in the area. Lisa Rubin, 39, calls their recoveries 
a miracle, considering the boy was shot in the neck. Several of the 
children still refut is leave, get out,'' Lisa Rubin said last week. 
But instinct isn't the main motivation for Rubin and most of her neighbors. 
``All we want to do is hold on to what belongs to us,'' she said. 
``I still drive in a car. I'm not going to let our enemy keep us from 
living day to day, going where I need to go.'' Most Jewish settlers, 
like the majority of Jews in Israel, support the U.S. war in Iraq. 
But many settlers fear Israel will suffer from Bush's efforts to promote 
the ``road map'' as political payback to British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair for his support on Iraq. ``It's obvious why President Bush will 
owe an incredible debt to Tony Blair,'' said Dina Shalit, deputy mayor 
in the town of Ariel, one of the largest Jewish communities in the 
West Bank. (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)@ Founded at the same time as Shilo, 
Ariel is held out as a shining example of success for the settlement 
movement. As a political and religious statement, the settlement movement 
gained momentum after the Six Day War of 1967, when Israel seized 
all of the previously divided Jerusalem and occupied the West Bank. 
Ariel, which in the 1990s roughly doubled in population, is located 
in the middle of the West Bank. It is a strategy for claiming land 
that settlers call ``creating facts on the ground.'' To Palestinians, 
it is blatant land-grabbing. Civic leaders take pride in Ariel's explosive 
growth. A small city of 18,000 people, it includes a 7,000-student 
university, a 100-room hotel and a downtown shopping area. The first 
high-rise in a West Bank Jewish community, an eight-story residential 
building, is under construction. Half the town's residents are Russians 
who immigrated in the 1990s. Growth has been helped by donations from 
wealthy Americans, including Christian groups whose prophetic missions 
align them with Jewish settlers. Ariel's numbers made the town ``irreversible'' 
about 10 years ago, Shalit said, meaning its residents could not be 
relocated. Most discussions of a peace plan include Ariel as part 
of Israel. Indeed, planners of an Israeli ``security fence'' under 
construction along the length of the West Bank proposed last week 
to have it make a detour around Ariel. Many settlers oppose the fence, 
saying it will create borders where there should be none. In other 
words, drawing a line around Ariel could make it easier to isolate 
and dismantle communities like Shilo that are more remote from Israel 
proper. ``We view this whole fence thing as a big mistake,'' Shalit 
said. ``Once you do it, it's a fait accompli.'' (OPTIONAL TRI EoDS)@ 
Eitan Turgeman, 39, a father of three who owns Ariel's beauty salon, 
said he is skeptical of any plan to create a Palestinian state near 
Israel. ``I don't mind that they have a state, but not close to me,'' 
Turgeman said, suggesting Egypt or Jordan would be better. ``I don't 
know if we can get along with them. As much as we give, it's not Enoegh. 
Whatever you give them, six fingers, 10 fingers, they're never satisfied.''

His $500,000 roving TV studio is the gizmo with the most razzle-dazzle 
in a war where marvelous inventions (videophones, satellite phon%s,, 
cell phones, nightscope lenses, digital cameras and battery-operated 
laptops), combined with unusual cooperation between the media and 
the military, have made Operation Iraqi Freedom the most television-accessible 
war in history. That combination of access and technology has provided 
viewers with remarkable journalism and touching TV moments. One highlight 
last week came when NBC/MSNBC reporter Kerry Sanders phoned home to 
Sugar Land, Texas, for wounded Lance Cpl. Joshua Menard of the 2nd 
Battalion 8th Marines. ``It just seemed like a logical thing to do,'' 
said Sanders. ``He was lucid and wanted to talk to us and I asked 
him if he wanted to say anything to family and friends.'' Connecting 
a faraway story to worried folks back home is a terrific example of 
how ``embedding'' reporters _ allowing them to travel with the troops 
_ has benefited both viewers and the image of the military. Sanders, 
it would turn out later, was among the first to transmit pictures 
of alarming finds in a ``hospital'' in An Nasiriyah _ evidence of 
apparent POW torture and hundreds of chemical suits. His reports have 
stood out, along with reports from CNN's Walt Rodgers, ABC's Ted Koppel, 
Fox's Rick Leventhal and CBS' Byron Pitts. They are among the hundreds 
of players in the battle for television viewers. Eleven days into 
the war, two networks have emerged as slightly better than others 
in providing balanced reporting, NBC among broadcast networks, MSNBC 
amonw!#mble networks. NBC has multiple outlets _ the ``Nightly News'' 
and several prime-time news hours each week as well as reports on 
its morning ``Today'' show and sister networks MSNBC, CNBC and Telemundo. 
ABC and CBS are only a whisker behind. ABC tripped at the start, caught 
shorts-down and 20 minutes late getting to air when the first U.S. 
missiles were launched March 19. The situation snafued from there 
when the network signed off its war coverage at 10 p.m. CST after 
promising more to come, leaving some markets (Houston not among them) 
in the lurch. But ABC recovered handsomely. For example, Friday's 
``20/20'' included a series of brilliant reports, including John Quinones' 
interview with an Umm Qasr family grateful to be out from under Saddam 
Hussein's thumb, and Barbara Walters' report on U.S.-ensconced Iraqis 
speaking out against Saddam Hussein. CBS, which has had to weave war 
news into college basketball coverage, has taken optimum advantage 
of its sterling magazines _ ``60 Minutes,'' ``60 Minutes II'' and 
``48 Hours Investigates'' _ to provide context and great prose in 
its news coverage. The cable networks are less interested in perspective 
and more interested in being first with the news and continuous. MSNBC 
is leading, for reasons already cited and because of no-nonsense anchoring 
from Lester Holt, a headline-updating service every 15 minutes and 
soft touches like its wall of heroes, where pictures of servicemen 
and servicewomen are displayed. CNN and Fox are a step behind. Two 
of CNN's biggest assets, Christiane Amanpour and Wolf Blitzer, are 
behind desks instead of doing what they do best: reporting. Reporters 
John King and Nic Robertson have become sideline players as CNN makes 
optimum use of yts emr;;:2case unto itself. It proudly wraps itself 
in the U.S. flag and openly cheers on Bush. Television critics may 
recoil at how unbalanced the network appears, but some Americans following 
the war apparently approve. A half-million more people are watching 
Fox (3.6 million) than CNN (3.1 million). MSNBC is far back (1.6 million) 
and CNBC trails (300,000), according to Nielsen Media Research. XXX

Five years ago, Cagle's latest would have made him a hit-making machine 
on new country radio. He's a Music Row dream, writing blue-collar 
country songs like Clint Black, singing them with the rugged voice 
of Tim McGraw and the emotional intuition of Faith Hill. Today, however, 
new country seems to sell best with a gimmick, such as the cowboy-meets-surfer 
persona of Kenny Chesney or the angry-American rants of Toby Keith. 
With the follow-up to his gold-selling debut, ``Play It Loud,'' Cagle 
will find out whether his old new country still sells. The first single, 
``What a Beautiful Day,'' should help pave the way. A simple fiddle-guitar 
melody is the blueprint for this love story, the first of many that 
dot the collection. Cagle's midrange twang lends itself to the style. 
Dressed up with a pop-piano opening and backing hums on the chorus, 
the arrangement leaves the country swing of George Strait behind and 
enters McGraw-style flash. It's a different approach for Cagle, who 
prides himself on being a hardscrabble cowboy with a lunchbox work 
ethic. That's about to change for good. With lyrics like ``Day 1, 
I stumbled through hello on Fifth Avenue. ... She said, `I Do' on 
Day 482, and gave me a son on Day 761,'' cowboys ant #gwgirls heading 
for the altar will be adding this to their wedding reception playlists 
en masse. Cagle mixes adult love songs (``I Love It When She Does 
That,'' ``Growin' Love'') and love-gone-wrong songs (``I'd Be Lying,'' 
``Look at What I've Done'') with a smattering of rev-ups. He seems 
to like driving honky-tonk when he's flirting and tender slow dances 
when he's romancing for keeps. Both styles usually include range-reaching 
choruses accompanied by fiddles, mandolins and guitars. The album 
would have benefited, however, if listeners heard more about the chase 
than the relationship that's dominating Cagle's thoughts. The stompin' 
whirl of ``Chicks Dig It,'' with its stories of impressing girls by 
acting like an idiot, is a highlight guys can relate to. The same 
goes for the dueling mandolin and mandocello describing the more physical 
``Everything.'' ``Cagle'' is catchy country, and might've been a multiplatinum 
winner in 1997. Today it might not be enough of an original twist 
on a highly profitable new country theme. Grade: C+ @XXX END OF STORY^

c.2003 Newhouse News Service@ WASHINGTON _ To pay for World War I, 
Americans eagerly bought ``Liberty Bonds.'' In World War II, they 
purchased more bonds and planted ``Victory Gardens'' at home to release 
food supplies for troops. Now, as the war in Iraq enters a potentially 
protracted phase and the fight against terrorism continues, some people 
are calling for a return to large-scale public sacrifice. They contend 
such efforts would promote unity and answer Americans' desire to be 
more involved in protecting their country. But there is little unanimity 
about what civilian sacrifice should entail, and plenty of suggestion 
that past endeavors are anachronistic today. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, 
President Bush has urged Americans to go about their daily lives and 
not succumb to fears about terrorism. He also created the USA Freedom 
Corps to provide more opportunities for citizens to perform volunteer 
work. Kenneth Pollack( q"senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, 
a Washington think tank, said the president should be requiring much 
more of the public. He suggested that Americans should be purchasing 
war bonds, among other things. ``We're really going to need to give 
a bit back to the collective entity of the United States in order 
to safeguard ourselves,'' said Pollack, a widely quoted authority 
on the Iraq war. ``I think that the administration has not done a 
very good job all along in making that clear, and I think what's going 
on in Iraq is part of that.'' (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)@ Sen. Joseph 
Lieberman, D-Conn., who is among the Democrats seeking to challenge 
Bush in 2004, agreed that Americans need new ways to become involved. 
He has promoted legislation that would enable young people to serve 
18 months in the military and a longer stint with the reserves in 
exchange for college tuition money. Lieberman also is considering 
creating ``Homeland Security Bonds'' that could finance domestic anti-terrorism 
efforts. Since December 2001, the government has been selling ``Patriot 
Bonds'' _ a retitled series of bonds that is not earmarked for counterterrorism 
activities. ``Soldiers are sacrificing in Iraq, so we need to sacrifice 
_ foT$for the sake of sacrifice, but in dealing with the war on terrorism,'' 
Lieberman said. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)@ Critics argue that enough is 
being asked of Americans _ and that society has evolved to the point 
that it need not follow old wartime modes of behavior. ``I already 
lived through the period where we got three gallons of gas a week, 
we got two pairs of shoes, one suit a year,'' said Sen. John Warner, 
R-Va., the 75-year-old chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
``When do we stop?'' To Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, 
a libertarian Washington think tank, pushing for large-scale self-sacrifice 
during wartime is essentially ``self-flagellation without purpose.'' 
``If there's a reason to do these kinds of things, we shouldn't be 
doing them under fraudulent pretenses,'' said Bandow, a nationally 
syndicated political columnist. ``To say that we should serve other 
people, you should make the argument that service is a good thing 
and that we have responsibilities to one another _ not because we're 
worried about al-Qaida.'' All too often, measures of civilian self-sacrifice 
are used to promote other rry Craig, R-Idaho, a conservative who wants 
to reduce government spending, said he would like to see non-defense 
domestic programs cut by 1 percent across the board this year to demonstrate 
the seriousness of the war's impact on the economy. ``Many of those 
who are coming to Washington to lobby me for different projects and 
programs are giving me the indication that they're expecting less 
than they otherwise might get because of this extraordinary situation,'' 
Craig said. On the opposite end of the political spectrum, some congressional 
Democrats say that if Bush is serious about self-sacrifice he should 
withdraw his proposal to cut taxes by $670 billion, an initiative 
they contend will benefit only the richest Americans. ``That budget 
of his certainly didn't call for mutual sacrifice,'' said Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, D-Mass. Such divergent opinions occurred less often in previous 
wars, when there was greater unanimity of public opinion. Historians 
say civilian sacrifice in those eras was usually _ but not always 
_ voluntary. President Herbert Hoover, who served as federal food 
administrator during World War I, called on restaurants to stop serving 
bread and had children eat ``patriotic potatoes'' instead of sandwiches 
with their school lunches. In World War II, the government engaged 
in stronger measures such as the rationing of steel, copper, oil and 
rubber. It wrote rules for, among other things, printing books with 
smaller margins so that paper would not be wasted. ``We seem to have 
returned to a period a bit like the 18th century, when wars were fought 
entirely by professional armies with civilians pretty much able to 
ignore the fact that we were at war,'' said James Hoopes, an American 
history professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. But the Bush 
administration's top official on public service strongly disagrees. 
Leslie Lenkowsky, chief executive officer of the Corporation for National 
Community Service, said plenty is being done in the name of sacrifice, 
citing the ongoing emergency response training and disaster preparedness 
efforts under way in cities ranging from New York to Mather, Calif. 
``The notion that somehow Americans have a free ride here is wrong,'' 
Lenkowsky said. ``People should remember that we already are making 
lots of sacrifice _ there are people with relatives in the military 
who are not with their loved ones and kids. And anyone who travels 
these days is operating under restraints.'' To that end, Lenkowsky 
encouraged Americans to be content with small gestures of sacrifice: 
``Here we are in Iraq fighting for democracy when people don't know 
quite enough about democracy. So turn off the TV and read a book about 
American history.'' LF END McCUTCHEON (Chuck McCutcheon can be contacted

I once wrote that ``librarians are indeed the unacknowledged legislators 
of the universe,'' and I meant it. Their pay stinks, their working 
conditions are worse than at the post office, but they bring the world 
to us. Now librarians are caught up in a dramatic First Amendment 
imbroglio over the recently adopted Children's Internet Protection 
Act. The case, US v. American Library Association et al., has reached 
the Supreme Court, with the ALA and the American Civil Liberties Union 
aligned against the government. The government's position is: We provide 
$200 million annually to public libraries for computer-related programs. 
As a condition of this aid, we demand that you filter out Internet 
pornography, especially for juvenile users. The ALA and ACLU oppose 
the law on more or less classic First Amendment grounds, arguing that 
libraries' Internet terminals are ``public forums'' where the government 
may not restrict speech. They feel strongly that filters or ``blocking'' 
technologies end up weeding out legitimate sites _ e.g., the Flesh 
Public Library in Piqua, Ohio _ along with the illegal child pornography 
and the garden-variety smut clogging up the Internet. Well, we're 
all against censorship _ or are we? While the ACLU and the usual band 
of First Amendment zealots are demanding let-it-all-hang-out Internet 
access in libraries, some resistance has arisen from an unexpected 
constituency: librarians. In Minneapolis last week, 12 librarians 
sued their employer in federal court, charging that the library's 
three-year-old Internet sites displayed ``virtually every imaginable 
kind of human sexual conduct,'' contributing to an ``intimidating, 
hostile and offensive workplace.'' ``We were living in hell, and they 
were unwilling to acknowledge the problem,'' plaintiff Wendy Adamson 
told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. In Toronto _ admittedly a city 
that won't be affected by the Supreme Court's decision _ a group of 
unruly teenagers chased a librarian out of her building when she shut 
off their Internet porn connection. A police officer told The Toronto 
Sun that teenagers consider the library better than an amusement arcade 
because the latter doesn't allow them free, unfettered access to all 
kinds of pornography. When writer Chris Rodell interviewed librarians 
for a column posted on the literary website mobylives.com, none wanted 
to question the ALA/ACLU First Amendment party line, at least not 
for attribution. ``This is happening in libraries all across the country,'' 
one unidentified libr19407:762)s, `Mom, I'm going to the library,' 
and the parents feel proud. But then some of these same kids and many 
adults will spend hours watching xoRjographic web sites right out 
in the open. It's very upsetting to some of our older librarians. 
But it's a First Amendment issue and there's not a thing we can do 
about it.'' That's not quite true. We can do several things. One is 
to accept the limitatiofskf the much-derided filters and use them 
anyway. The government argues, convincingly, that when libraries use 
the filters, ``They are simply declining to put on their computer 
screens the same content they have traditionally excluded from their 
bookshelves.'' A second possibility is the so-called ``Boston solution,'' 
adopted several years ago in Copley Square by the nation's oldest 
public library. At the Boston Public Library, president Bernard Margolis 
explains, the children's and teenagers' rooms have Internet terminals 
that filter out porn. The grown-ups use different computers and can 
visit the Flesh Public Library or order the Flesh Gordon video. If 
a person under 18 wants access to the wider world of Web wonders, 
he or she can get it, with signed permission from a parent. ``That 
puts the decision with the parent, where it belongs, and not with 
us,'' Margolis says. I know where I stand on this. I'm behind the 
government and I'm tired of First Amendment shilly-shallying that 
fills my children's Hotmail screens with dozens of porn come-ons every 
day. But I will defer to Justice David Souter's eventual opinion in 
US v. ALA, (1) because he cares about the First Amendment in an intelligent 
way, and (2) because it was once said of him, correctly, that ``he 
regards Boston as the center of the civilized world.'' Alex Beam is

I've always been convijcuf that the trick to living in Massachusetts 
is to stay in the spring, summer, and fall and leave in the winter. 
But I have changed my mind. Now I think the trick is to stay during 
the economic booms and leave during the busts. They are nastier than 
the winters. For the second straight economic downturn, Massachusetts 
has earned a dubious distinction: It has lost a greater percentage 
of its jobs than any other state in the nation. According to Northeastern 
University's Center for Labor Market Studies, between January 2001 
and January 2003, the first two years of this slowdown, Massachusetts 
lost 157,000 jobs, or 4.7 percent of its total employment. No other 
state lost as much as 4 percent. In the slump that lasted from 1989 
to 1992, Massachusetts lost 11.6 percent of its jobs, which tied it 
with Rhode Island for the worst employment record in the country. 
In both downturns, Massachusetts lost a far greater share of its jobs 
than the country as a whole.Do you think we could put that on our 
license plates? ``Massachusetts: Where Jobs Disappear.'' The poor 
performance doesn't square with the state's image of itself. Nor does 
it lend itself to any obvious explanation. Is it plain old bad luck? 
The curse of the Bambino? Or is there something more profound at work 
that makes Massachusetts more economically fragile than other states? 
On the surface, the current slump and the slump of the early 1990s 
don't have a lot in common. Kn(uhe words of Frederick Breimyer, chief 
economist at State Street Corp., the recession that hit more than 
a decade ago was largely ``made in Massachusetts.'' The state's big 
computer companies missed the personal computer revolution, a mistake 
that cost them profits and jobs. The end of the Cold War led to downsizing 
in the defense industry. Those events put the brakes on a booming 
real estate and construction market, which in turn, dragged down much 
of the local banking industry. It was a n)uclear-style chain reaction 
that destroyed almost everyt|&gt;[e the nation experienced a modest 
recession. The current slowdown had its origins in the national stock 
market boom of the 1990s. When the bubble burst three years ago, two 
industries, technology and finance, suddenly found themselves vulnerable. 
It just so happens that those two industries are pillars of the Massachusetts 
economy. The state has lost a big chunk of its technology jobs, both 
manufacturing and service. Also gone are the jobs of thousands of 
people who profited from the boom _ everyone from accountants to lawyers 
to consultants. Still to come: public sector layoffs as state government 
copes with the fiscal crisis the economic crisis has generated. No 
one is really sure what links the state's two downturns, but in a 
search for common ground, two things stand out. The first is that 
Massachusetts has an economy that apparently is susceptible to bubbles. 
``In both the 1980s and 1990s,'' said Paul Harrington, a Northeastern 
University economist, ``we got caught up in speculation.'' In the 
1980s, the speculation was in real estate; more recently it was in 
stocks. Like a rider on a steep roller coaster, Massachusetts soared 
on the way up and plunged on the way down, an unsettling experience. 
The other link between the slumps is technology. Technology is the 
ultimate source of growth. The states that don't have it want it desperately. 
But technology is inherently volatile. The new new thing inevitably 
gets replaced by something even newer. And in a competitive world, 
the next generation of products comes around faster than ever. ``If 
we are going to rely on technology, we have to understand that there 
will be fallow times,'' said Breimyer. Massachusetts will be back. 
Its mix of businesses _ technology, finance, and healthcare _ are 
the industries of the future. Trouble is, the future hasn't arrived 
yet, and in the meantime life isn't so rosy here in the state of unemployment.

Town Hall in this hamlet of 3,400 is a Victorian brick building with 
bow windows which houses a public library open only 15 hours a week 
and a part-time clerk who keeps jelly beans for the selectmen. Even 
if a sign over the door didn't identify it as municipal headquarters, 
its location would keep a passerby from mistaking it for someone's 
grand old house. The triangle where it sits has monuments to Cheshire 
residents who fought, and sometimes died, in the nation's wars. The 
stone honor roll of those who served in World War I notes just one, 
Thomas E. Courtney, who died in battle. A larger monument lists the 
339 Cheshire residents who fought in wars from World War II to Desert 
Storm, and the asterisk beside a few _ seven in World War II, including 
brothers Andries and Daniel Curtin; two in Korea; two in Vietnam _ 
memorializes those killed in action. Yet a wreath of artificial carnations 
in red, white, and blue, on a stand between the scrolls, has no name 
attached. Everyone here knows it is for Sergeant Daniel H. Petithory, 
the young US Army Special Forces soldier killed by friendly fire in 
Afghanistan on Dec. 5, 2001. Now comes another war. With the memory 
of Petithory's loss still fresh, people in this quiet Berkshires town 
are divided over the wisdom of the current conflict in the Persian 
Gulf. This is a community where residents tend to work in sales or 
manufacturing or construction or the service sector, where Democrats 
outnumber Republicans by more than two to one, but there are more 
unenrolled voters than members of either party combined. Vociferous 
protest and rampant flag-waving are the stuff of other places, but 
war is on the mind here, too. The town clerk's office, busy one morning 
with license renewals for Cheshire's 700 dogs, attracts a stream of 
pet owners who are skeptical about the war. ``Everybody is behind 
all the young people over there,'' says Town Clerk Christine Emerson, 
55. ``We just don't think they should be there.'' Ask whether this 
war feels different from the one that claimed Petithory at the age 
of 32, and opinion diverges. ``When that happened, we were responding 
to a direct attack,'' says David Phelps, 53, a bookmobile driver here 
to register a mixed breed named Fuzzy. ``I still don't see the connection 
between Saddam and 9/11. They're trying to make that case, but they 
haven't made it with me.'' Emerson disagrees. ``I didn't like Afgxanisrn 
wood floor, whirring ceiling fans, and kerosene pump evoke a bygone 
era when a general store didn't have to specialize in power equipment 
to stay in business. The talk between two World War II veterans decidedly 
favors disarming Saddam Hussein by force. ``Oh, I'm all for it,'' 
says customer Albert LaVigne, 77, a retired applications engineer 
for General Electric. ``That whole regime should come down. I do believe 
he's loaded with weapons of mass destruction.'' ``It had to be done,'' 
says Stanley Reynolds, 76, whose family has owned the store since 
1937. ``The UN has to be a pretty soft organization. It doesn't have 
the courage to stand up.'' In a state where almost one-fifth of the 
population is minority, Cheshire is overwhelmingly homogenous _ 98 
percent of its residents are white. Half the population is over 40, 
a good four years older than the state's median age and almost a decade 
older than Boston's. Massachusetts may boast a well-educated workforce 
and a number of prestigious universities, but here only 20 percent 
of residents over the age of 25 have graduated from college. Cheshire 
sent Danny Petithory, known years ago for his prowess playing hide-and-seek, 
from Hoosac Valley Regional High School straight to the Army. Nestled 
between Pittsfield and Adams, Cheshire is big enough for one traffic 
light but too small for a town green. As the hills that surround it 
blush pink in anticipation of spring, a long winter terbkes on a still-frozen 
Hoosac Lake where two hardy men venture out on a mild March morning. 
The houses here are modest ranches or simple frame homes, with a trailer 
per{"at one end of town and a small subdivision of spacious new homes 
at another. The Appalachian Trail runs through Cheshire, and so does 
a new bicycle path, the Ashuwillticook Rail Trail. Last fall a portion 
of it was dedicated to Petithory, and in a resting spot with two benchesba 
plaque says he ``made the ultimate sacrifice for his nation'' in Kandahar. 
Scattered around town are American flags _ on houses, on car antennae, 
in jars on the front counter at HD Reynolds. On Emerson's table in 
the town clerk's office is a basket of pins with red, white, and blue 
ribbons that she's remembered to put out most days since Sept. 11, 
2001. The Country Charm restaurant is displaying yellow ribbons. Petithory's 
parents declined to speak to a reporter, but from their porch they 
fly a US flag and a purple banner emblazoned with a cross and a dove. 
Petithory was the first Cheshire soldier to be killed in action since 
Vietnam, and his death brings war home to a new generation. Keith 
Bona, a 34-year-old printer in North Adams who didn't even know Petithory, 
sold teddy bears with green berets and netted $20,000 for a scholarship 
in the slain sergeant's memory. Theminimart at O'Connell's Shell station 
here in Cheshire sold 1,500. Bruce Bissaillon met Petithory in kindergarten, 
and last year he helped organize a golf tournament in memory of his 
close friend. He's a waiter at Lakeside Restaurant, where a hamburger 
goes for $2, and he mentions Petithory in the breath after pledging 
support for the Iraq war. ``I'm for it. He's had 12 years to disarm. 
It's time,'' says Bissaillon, 34. ``My friend died in Afghanistan.'' 
In Town Hall, Kathy Bedard, 57, a retired accountant getting licenses 
for her three German shepherds, invokes Petithory's memory from a 
different point of view. ``It was the first thing I thought of when 
I saw the POWs on TV. I don't think the Petithorys will ever recover,'' 
she says. ``I think that's why we're so against it. The pain is real. 
You can relate to the parents.'' Now a new war places burdens on other 
shoulders. Stephen La Fogg, a concrete foreman and an Army reservist, 
lives down the streetow. His 14-year-old son has taken over fixing 
the sump pump and installing a faucet. ``I feel sad doz!everyone,'' 
says La Fogg's wife, Lu Ann, also 47. ``I have to support my husband 
100 percent, and I do support the president 100 percent. I am nervous. 
I don't know how to explain it. I'm pretty sure he's going to be safe, 
but there's always that feeling.'' In the garage at the sprawling 
Bedard Bros. auto dealership overlooking Hoosac Lake, Michael Hosier 
works on a pickup truck's clutch fan. His son Michael Jr., 21, is 
a Marine fighting in Iraq, which has Hosier looking at the war through 
a very personal prism. ``As long as he's OK, it's a great thing,'' 
Hosier says. ``If he's hurt, it's not so good. I believe the guy (Hussein) 
shouldn't be in power, but I think it's not all up to us.'' Bedard, 
with 55 workers, is the town's largest employer. Banners for Volvo, 
Dodge, and Honda flutter in the wind beside flags of the United States 
and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Opinion at Bedard is mixed. 
``I'm a veteran myself, so I'm very supportive of it,'' says Sean 
Bailey, a 37-year-old salesman who was in the Air Force just prior 
to the first Gulf War. ``I hope it turns out to be the reason we went 
over there. The weapons of mass destruction.'' Fellow salesman Richard 
McCarthy, 57, is a veteran, too. He served in Vietnam. ``No one who 
has seen war is in favor of war,'' he says. ``I don't believe the 
evidence they produced was enough to justify the loss of life on both 
sides. I'm not going to get on a soapbox and suggest everyone should 
think like I do. I'll do it through the ballot box.'' Their boss, 
Brian Bedard, 47, brother-in-law of Kathy Bedard, hesitates, too. 
``I think it's just a situation where even if we're totally successful 
it isn't going to resolve the situation,'' he says. ``I don't agree 
with any protests at this point. Prior to, it's fine, but once the 
process is started you have to throw your support to the troops.'' 
One of the smallest businesses in town is T's Treats, open since January 
in a modest red box of a building up the road from the bike path and 
the Appalachian Trail. While her 4-year-old son Tyler plays with a 
truck at her feet, proprieter Tina Lancia, 33, embroiders canvas bags 
for Easter. She sells homemade cookies, pretzels, and eclairs. ``I 
guess I'm on both sides,'' she says. ``I strongly feel something should 
have been done. But, at the same time, did we have to go to war, you 
know?'' In the post office next door, attorney Edmund St. Jnhj, 52, 
picks up his mail and remembers protesting against the Vietnam War. 
He questions this war, too, but he looks back with regret at the tone 
of the antiwar movement of three decades ago. ``The mistake a lot 
of us made at that time is that we didn't support our troops,'' he 
says. ``What I find distressing is the way we treated those guys when 
they came back. I wouldn't want to see that happen to those guys who 
are over there now.'' St. John says hello to an older woman leaWing 
the post office. ``She lost a son in Vietnam,'' he murmurs after the 
door swings closed behind her. The town cemetery is the final resting 
place of Howard Luscier and Chester Witanek, the two sons of Cheshire 
who died in Vietnam. Civil War veterans, who came home gravely ill 
with dysentery, are buried here, too, So is Daniel Petithory. At the 
base of his pink marble tombstone, mourners have placed three Heineken 
beer-bottle caps, a Ziploc bag with a Green Beret teddy bear and a 
T-shirt from the Daniel Petithory olG Tournament, and four tiny plastic 
soldiers. Three are crouched, aiming rifles at an invisible foe. The 
other one has fallen.

It's hard to imagine a pop-music artist who could be more out of fashion 
at this point than Joni Mitchell: a nakedly honest, introspective 
folkie who doesn't apologize for noodling around with less-accessible 
jazz riffs scarcely fits in a landscape filled with hip-hop braggadocio 
and teen-pop inanity. But Mitchell's strength was always that she 
never sought pop stardom, tonight's ``American Masters'' (memo to 
PBS: Mitchell is Canadian) notes; that's what kept her music pure, 
even if no one really wanted to hear it. Writer/director/producer 
Susan Lacy, who seems to have created a documentary intended most 
of all to please her subject, suggests that if Mitchell failed fans' 
expectations, fans likewise failed hers by expecting her to endlessly 
churn out carbon copies of her hit ``Court and Spark.'' (Nonetheless, 
few hard-core music fans have that album, but wouldn't be caught dead 
without a copy of her earlier recording ``Blue''). ``Sweet Joni from 
Saskatchewan,'' as Neil Young called her in an unreleased song, grew 
up a recluse, had a youthful romantic life euphemistically described 
as ``difficult,'' yet managed to become a star via her intimate songwriting. 
Lacy's film combines many early video performances acy may gloss over 
Mitchell's career lulls and profligate romanticism and not quite offer 
an insightful glimpse into her creative process, but she offers fans 
plenty of her best music at length, not diced up in the MTV fashion 
preferred nowadays. ``Woman of Heart and Mind'' is clearly designed 
for unquestioning fans, and it might just earn Mitchell a new convert 
or two.&lt; ---&lt; JONI MITCHELL: WOMAN OF HEART AND MIND&lt; 3 stars&lt; 
What: ``American Masters'' documentary about the singer/songwriter.&lt; 
Where: PBS.&lt; When: 9 tonight.&lt; In a nutshell: Hagiography for 
fans, with generous dollops of music.&lt;

STUDENTS LEARNING JAPANESE SEE BRIGHT JOB MARKET AHEAD@&lt; (For use 
by New York Times News Service clients.)@&lt; \Bq!HECTOR SALDANA@= 
c.2003 San Antonio Express-News@= SAN ANTONIO _ They start each day 
with a respectful bow and a cheerful, ``Ohay gozaimasu.'' That ``good 
morning'' is directed at teacher Rieko O'Donnell, whose day has started 
that way with her Japanese language students at Tafolla Middle School 
for the past eight years. At the school, the daily morning ritual 
signals ``respect, and that we're ready to learn,'' O'Donnell said. 
``Just like Japanese students.'' With`thD recent announcement that 
Toyota Motor Corp. is locating south$ov"San Antonio, her p2edNminantly 
Hispanic students realize they have made a smart choice for their 
future. Many of the students in the three-year program already are 
thinking !boTt jobs at Toyota, which announced Feb. 5 that it would 
build Tundra pickup truck assembly plant in this South Texas city 
of more than 1 million people. The factory is expected to provide 
about 2,000 high-wage jobs, about 80 percent of which will be labor-)ntDnsive 
assembly line positions. Initial payroll for the plant, scheduled 
to open in 2006, will be $100 million. Celeste Guzman said her grandmother 
wanted her to learn French. ``But she$txknks this is better with Toyota 
coming,'' says the 12-year-old. Students from 40 San Antonio School 
District schools are bused to Tafolla for intensive classes in Spanish, 
Russian, Japanese, French and German. Children apply for admission 
while in the fifth grade. Only about 125 slots are available each 
year. Once accepted, students must maintain a 75 grade-point average. 
Japanese now ranks third behind Spanish and Russian in popularity 
at Tafolla. Lately, required essays for admission to the multilingual 
program mention the auto manufacturer more and more. O'Donnell's third-floor 
classroom is decorated with maps, calendars and pictures of her homeland. 
Overhead hang Japanese lanterns called chouchin. Colorful carp streamers 
called koinobori decorate the walls. The teacher stages Japanese plays, 
some based on historical events more than 600 years ago, to help children 
understand the language and culture. Her students must memorize lines 
and act out the parts. ``We are very proud people,'' O'Donnell explains. 
She urges her students to ``always be polite, because you are representing 
Tafolla's Japanese class _ the best in Texas.'' Her class is conducted 
100 percent in Japanese _ reading, writing, comprehension, translation 
and cultural study. Students maintain a weekly journal in traditional 
hiragana handwriting. O'Donnell acknowledges that her middle school 
students are learning high school- and college-level Japanese. ``Some 
kids can't make it,'' she says. ``It's a vigorous program.'' But dreams 
are born here more often than not. ``At first, it started because 
I wanted to read Pokemon cards,'' said Joshua Mariscao, a student. 
``The goal now is to go to Japan and open a business there.'' The 
students see themselves breaking down old prejudices. Stereotypes 
give way to understanding. It's not a major leap, says the teacher, 
``because Hispanic culture is very family-oriented, and so are we.''

It is hailed as the zenith of human performance, an event testing 
the true mettle of athletes _ the marathon, a 26-mile, joint-jolting 
measure of running prowess and emotional endurance. But just how good 
is it for the human body to be pushed so far for so long? ``I don't 
think anybody can tell you what the optimal level of physical activity 
is to get all of the health benefits that we all want,'' said Dr. 
Miriam Nelson, a nutrition and physical activity specialist at Tufts 
University's Friedman School. ``But the reality is, it's not the marathon.'' 
But if you do take feet to pavement for this year's Boston Marathon, 
it's caveat runner. There are the minor injuries _ pulled muscles, 
blisters, shin splints. And then there are the potentially life-threatening 
medical crises _ heat stroke, water intoxication, heart failure. ``It 
is a double-edged sword,'' said 1976 Boston Marathon champion Jack 
Fultz, now coach of the Dana-Farber Marathon Challenge team and an 
adviser to Nike. ``Training for and running a marathon can be a very 
beneficial thing for one's physical stature, but it can also be very 
detrimental.'' To be sure, most runners in this year's Boston Marathon 
will finish the race without incurring major complications. But, as 
the death last year of runner Cynthia Lucero revealed, marathoning 
is no trivial pursuit. Lucero's demise was attributed to drinking 
excessive fluids during the Boston race, a phenomenon known as hyponatremia 
_ water intoxication. For runners accustomed to the maxim that too 
much water is never enough, the death of Lucero demonstrated the perils 
of downing extreme amounts of liquid. The result _ a profound dilution 
of sodium in the blood, which in turn can cause lethal brain swelling. 
More broadly, researchers have come to understand that the water intoxication 
of marathoners reflects the body's systemic response to being driven 
to such extremes. In fact, Dr. David Greenes of Children's Hospital 
Boston, who is presiding over a major study of runners' health, refers 
to a marathon as ``a scheduled disease.'' Last year, the research 
team cobbled together by Greenes tracked 484 Boston Marathon runners. 
While their findings await formal release, Greenes did reveal that 
a substantial chunk of the runners had dangerously low sodium levels 
_ even if they had not complained of symptoms related to hyponatremia. 
``There are, no doubt, some health benefits to training as vigorously 
as people do for marathoning,'' Greenes said. ``But I think there 
are a|eed to understand what the risk factors are for the rare but 
unfortunate outcomes that we see.'' That is precisely what Dr. Arthur 
Siegel has been doing after hanging up his own marathon shoes in the 
late 1980s. His work revolves around the notion that marathoning produces 
such acute injury to the architecture of the body that a massive inflammatory 
response ensues. One manifestation of that, he said, can be found 
in the blood of runners. After examining samples drawn from 80 marathoners, 
Siegel concluded that the morning after a race, the balance between 
blood thickening and blood thinning factors was out of whack. Clotting 
and inflammatory factors were elevated, putting runners at risk of 
heart attacks. The kidneys of runners can be inflamed, too, Siegel 
reports, furTheb evidence of what happens when asking the human body 
to cover 26 miles in a few hours. A marathon ``is an overdose of a 
good thing,'' said Siegel,indernal medicine chief at McLean Hospital 
in Belmont. ``But the that marathoners consider taking an aspirin 
to give them an edge against potential blood clotting. ``What I tell 
people is that a marathon is a very special event,'' said Dr. Lyle 
Micheli, who has treated injuries for three decades at the Boston 
Marathon. ``Don't think of it as parT ov your daily health regimen.''

In a statement attributed to Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader called 
on Tuesday for a holy war, or jihad, against the American-led invasion 
of Iraq. ``They are cursed. They are evil,'' said the statement, which 
was read by the information minister on national television. ``You 
will be victorious and they will be defeated. Hit them, fight them!'' 
Saddam appears almost nightly on Iraqi television, ostensibly leading 
conferences on the war. But his statement on Tuesday was delivered 
by Information Minister Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, leading to a new 
round of speculation about Saddam's whereabouts or health. ``Fight 
them(eVarywhere, as you fight them today,'' the statement said. ``Don't 
give them a chance to take a breath until they withdraw and retreat 
from Islamic land. And they will be cursed today and forever.'' There 
was no immediate response from Washington. Analysts with the CIA have 
checked each of Saddam's television appearances since the war began 
in an effort to discern whether the broadcasts were recent or made 
by a Saddam lookalike. Al-Sahhaf, continuing to read from the statement, 
which was delivered in Arabic and translated into English, said: ``The 
aggression that the aggressors are carrying out against the stronghold 
of faith is an aggression on the religion, the wealth, the honor and 
the soul and an aggression on the land of Islam. ``Therefore jihad 
is a duty and whoever dies will be rewarded by heaven,'' he said. 
``And God will be satisfied with their sacrifice. Take your chance. 
This is what God requested from you.'' ``Long live our nation! Long 
live Palestine! Long live Iraq!'' the statement continued. ``Let's 
go and do jihad.''

RECALLING THE BRUTAL SIDE OF WARFARE@&lt; Commentary@&lt; (For use 
by New York Times News Service clients.)@&lt; By JOAN RYAN@= c.2003 
San Francisco Chronicle@= NOVATO, Calif. _ Even 60 years later, they 
can't speak of things they saw during the war. They are old men now. 
One carves gorgeous duck decoys in his retirement. He still hunts 
and fishes. The other has been slowed by heart problems. They watch 
the images now on television of another generation of troops who are 
much like they were. Young. Scared. Proud. Horrified. The sorting-out 
process, separating the haunting from the beautiful, the exhilarating 
from the gruesome, continues still, as if the memories are so extreme 
and contradictory they don't slip neatly into the brain's filing system. 
Yet Bill Neal says of his military service, ``Mt0uas the greatest 
experience in the world.'' He is the decoy carver. He is a little 
hard of hearing and speaks softly, as if accustomed to the quiet of 
his own company. William Garner nods. ``I think it makes you a better 
man,'' Neal continues. We're sitting at a table in an empty room of 
the Margaret Todd Senior Center in Novato. Both live nearby. Neal 
served in the Army during World War II, working as a gunner on bombers 
over Germany. Garner was a boatswain in the Navy, fighting in the 
Pacific. They recall the most minute details of their experiences, 
like baseball heroes recounting the particulars of every game. They 
share mostly the funny stories and the stories about famous battles. 
Garner tells how he served with all three generations of McCain men, 
first in World War II, then Korea and Vietnam. He talks about Guadalcanal 
and Iwo Jima. Neal tells of the three fellow POWs who made their own 
liquor out of dried fruit and sugar and got so drunk that the next 
morning, with the three out cold, their stalag mates tied them into 
chairs and lined them up outside so they wouldn't miss roll call. 
Neal laughs softly at the story, which is smooth and polished from 
retelling. He won't say much else about the POW camp in Germany, where 
he spent a year, or about the 289-mile, 19-day forced march tto tell 
you, things that would make your stomach turn,'' he says. ``It stays 
with you. This group over in Iraq now will bring back some bad memories. 
Some of them will crack under the strain.'' He saw momentary video 
clips of the POWs taken in Iraq last week. He knew the look of absolute 
fear, of wondering if a minute from now you'll get a bullet in the 
head. ``I thought, `Oh those poor guys,'' Neal says. He and Garner 
say they hate war, as they say any reasonable person does, but they 
support the decision to oust Saddam and his weaponry. ``Better now 
than later,'' Garner says. Yet they also know that the men and women 
fighting there will return home changed. They'll carry pieces of the 
war like shrapnel. When Garner goes to Navy reunions and talks about 
the old days with his mates, he says there are long minutes when the 
group falls silent. ``You know everybody is remembering. There are 
memories that just tear at you. You don't even talk about them to 
each other. There are stories I have never even told my wife. You 
live with them for the rest of your life. They touch your soul forever.'' 
We think we're seeing the war on television. But 60 years from now, 
when old men sit around recounting the war in Iraq, they'll fall silent 
sometimes, too, like Garner and Neal, remembering the stories that 
are never told. ___@&lt; E-mail: joanryan(at)sfchronicle.com

The Italian police have arrested four men in the northern cities of 
Milan and Parma on suspicion of having links to international terrorism 
and possession of false documents, a police spokeswoman said on Tuesday. 
The suspects, two Kurdish men, an Egyptian and a Somalian, were taken 
into custody late Monday by the Italian antiterrorism police, the 
spokeswoman, Alessandra Simone, said. According to the police, the 
four are Islamic radicals connected to both al-Qaida and the Ansar 
al-Islam terror group, which the United States has accused of manufacturing 
poisons in chemical weapons plants in northern Iraq and of aiding 
al-Qaida in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Ansar's founder has denied 
ties between the two groups. Ansar was ousted from its territory in 
northeastern Iraq last weekend. The assault, a combination of U.S. 
airstrikes and a ground attack led by Special Forces coordinating 
with indigenous Kurdish fighters, resulted in the capture of several 
villages held by Ansar and the group's offices, bunkers, barracks 
and camps. The destruction and capture of the militant camps ``is 
a setback for the terrorist infrastructure,'' the prime minister of 
the eastern Kurdish zone, Dr. Barham Salih, said. But he warned, ``That 
does not mean the end of the terrorist problem.'' The chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard B. Myers, recently told CNN 
in a recent interview that ``it's from this site where people were 
trained and where poisons were developed that migrated into Europe.'' 
The Italian police said the arrests were the fruit of a long investigation, 
one that Italian media reports said included intercepted satellite 
phone conversations between the suspected cell members and villages 
in Iraq. According to Corriere della Sera, One of Italy's major newspapers, 
those conversations suggested the plotting of terror activity. ``We're 
ready, the thing is big,'' one of the suspected terrorist cell members 
was recorded as saying, according to the newspaper, which also reported 
that the police decided to arrest the men after learning that they 
were planning to leave the country for nrecruiting Iraqi and Kurdish 
volunteers to fight U.S. and British coalition forces in Iraq. But 
the police confirmed only that the two Kurds were charged with promoting 
clandestine immigration. They are suspected of helping other Kurds 
sneak into into European countries through Italy.

HIGH-TECH MILITARY FACES SUPREME TEST IN URBAN WARFARE@ ATTENTION

News Service@ (UNDATED) Street battles in Baghdad could bring the 
most sobering test yet for U.S. military technology designed to prevent 
casualties and root out urban guerrillas. Global-positioning technology 
and satellita smmmunications used so effectively to target enemy tanks, 
bla3t Lilitary bases and keep units in sync won't help troops in street 
battles. In close quarters, these signals may fail, and air and artillery 
support may be unusable. Most front-line soldiers carry some form 
of a hand-held global-positioning device to help them radio in targeting 
positions and execute missions. Troops may also be carrying several 
kinds of radios, including short-range devices that let individuals 
in one unit talk with those in another during close combat, said Army 
Capt. Michael Wise, who was a signal commander in Bosnia. Another 
device may allow communication as far away as bases in Kuwait, Wise 
said. ``Ideally we want every soldier and piece of gear to be able 
to identify itself ... so we can dispense with the radio chatter of 
old in which 65 (percent) to 75 percent was consumed with, `Where 
are you and what are you doing?''' said Douglas Johnson, a professor 
of national security affairs at the Army War College in Carlisle, 
Pa. Johnson saw how technology could aid in close-quarters conflict 
a couple of years ago, when a squad of soldiers in a simulation were 
handed night goggles, global-positioning technology and special intersquad 
radios to catch a sniper _ an exercise that often results in simulated 
casualties of a dozen or more killed. The troops with the new technology 
moved at three times their normal speed and neutralized the sniper 
with one soldier killed and one wounded. But thqt's this isn't a good 
laboratory,'' said Army spokesman Tim Rider, who is working at Camp 
Doha, Kuwait, with technology that constantly updates British and 
American units with the location of both friendly and enemy troops. 
Hundreds of commanders can use the technology through computers mounted 
in vehicles withil m`ch Army unit. They can add details about enemy 
troops and their own movements, which are then beamed by satellite 
and shared among everyone with the equipment. Rider said the computerized 
troop locator basically keeps tabs on vehicles and isn't meant to 
track individual guerrillas who may be roaming throughout a city the 
size of Baghdad. Indeed, much of the technology U.S. forces in Iraq 
have been relying on in the desert may become useless in urban warfare. 
Global positioning satellite signals may cut out when troops crawl 
into tunnels or dart through buildings, experts say. Text and photographic 
traffic is regularly blocked in urban combat, and even basic radio 
can fail altogether, they say. There is some question whether the 
military even has mastered the current technology. RAND Corp. analysts 
have warned that the military's rapid adoption of technology may leave 
many troops unfamiliar with what they're carrying. Johnson wonders 
what role the new technology has played in the war's friendly-fire 
incidents _ attacks that global positioning technology is intended 
to avert. ``The systems are apparently not working in harmony yet,'' 
Johnson said. ``We do not yet know what the real causes (of the mishaps) 
are, but it is clear that the high-tech systems are not yet perfect.'' 
Military officials ent"their suppliers are watching to see how their 
soldiers and equipment work on a real battlefield. RB END SEPER (Chris

Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said on Tuesday that 
he was launching a new effort to reunite the Turkish and Greek sectors 
of Cyprus, a development that could enhance Turkey's frustrated bid 
to join the European Union. Erdogan said that his foreign minister, 
Abdullah Gul, would visit Cyprus on Thursday to talk with Turkish 
Cypriot leaders there, and that he and Gul would discuss the issue 
with Greek ,maders at a Balkans summit in Belgrade next week. ``We're 
not about to give up on searching for a solution,'' Erdogan told lawmakers 
here on Tuesday, referring to the collapse last month of a reunification 
deal promoted by Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations. 
``We want to make new initiatives, new openings,'' said the prime 
minister. He did not provide any details on what Turkey would propose 
or how it would differ from the U.N. plan, which called for two ``constituent'' 
states under a central govey, and European Union officials have said 
that in the absence of a settlement, the union will admit only the 
Greek part of Cyprus into the union next year, when 10 new countries 
are scheduled to join. If that happens, it would diminish Turkey's 
chances of future membership. Turkey has not yet been given a firm 
start date for membership talks and already faces plenty of obstacles. 
European Union officials have long complained about Turkey's record 
on human rights, especially its treatment of ethnic Kurds, and are 
watching closely for any movement by Turkish troops into the Kurdish 
region of Iraq during the war there. They have warned those troops 
away, saying Turkey's future membership in the union could be at stake. 
At the same time, the war has badly damaged Turkey's relationship 
with the United States, leaving the country's western alliances on 
shaky ground. Erdogan's announcement about Cyprus raised the possibility 
that Turkey's rift with the United States would prod it to reach out 
more aggressively to Europe. ``If Turkey manages to alienate both 
the EU and the U.S., then it's got no friends at all in the world,'' 
said Heather Grabbe, an expert on European expansion at the Center 
for European Reform in London. ``Turkey doesn't have a lot of friends 
to play with,'' Grabbe said. ``It's a really critical moment, when 
Turks have decisions to make about how their future foreign policy 
is going to work.'' While Turkish Cypriots seem to be strongly in 
favor of the reunification of Cyprus, which has been divided since 
1974, the Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, has been an obstacle. 
Denktash has long been supported by Turkey's powerful generals, who 
see Cyprus as strategically valuable and are not close to Erdogan. 
``There will be strong resistance to resolving this problem,'' said 
Rusen Cakir, a Turkish political analyst.

At one point in ``Fellini: I'm a Born Liar,'' Donald Sutherland recalls 
a deleted scene from ``Casanova'' in which, as he puts it, ``Fellini 
makes love with a man.'' The actor does not correct his slip _ it 
is Casanova, the character played by Sutherland, not the director, 
who is amorously engaged _ which is almost as telling as his having 
committed it in the first place. In addition to being, by his own 
admission, a fabricator of untruths, Federico Fellini was a consummate 
narcissist. His movies, neo-realist or phantasmagorical, black-and-white 
or color, grand or merely grandiose, were at bottom all about himself. 
This is not meant as criticism. In the long interview that takes up 
most of this fascinating new documentary, Fellini recounts a dream, 
in which Picasso serves him an omelet, and reflects on the affinity 
between them, which is less a matter of artistic style than of temperament. 
Speaking in 1993, a few months before his death, Fellini is not so 
much indulging in vanity as placing himself in appropriate company. 
In a posthumous appreciation in The New Yorker, Clive James wrote 
that Fellini's ``individuality resided in his being able to see what 
was universal about himself,'' and that his ability to reflect his 
country and his personality through the bright lens of his art made 
him ``one of the great men of the modern world.'' There are those 
who would quarrel with that assessment, and who might even deny that 
Fellini should be counted among the great postwar Italian filmmakers. 
I am not one of them, and neither, from what I gather, is Damian Pettigrew, 
the director of ``Fellini: I'm a Born Liar,'' which opens on Wednesday 
at Film Forum. Pettigrew's affection for Fellini and his films animates 
this documentary and limits its appeal. Aficionados will be enthralled 
by the master's ramblings and ruminations, thrilled at behind-the-scenes 
glimpses of his working methods and delighted to sample snippets of 
his movies, ones famous and obscure. But for skeptics and novices, 
the experience will be less satisfying: familiarity with Fellini's 
life and his oeuvre is assumed. There is no biography beyond the restatement 
of some well-known facts: he grew up in Rimini, the Italian seaside 
resort, and was married for many years to Giulietta Masina, who starred 
in many of his pictures. The film clips and interview subjects seem 
to have been selected haphazardly, and are identified only at the 
end. Sutherland and Roberto Benigni may be easy to recognize, but 
even the most passionate devotees of Italian cinema may find it hard 
to identify Fellini's off-camera collaborators _ like the screenwriter 
Tullio Pinelli or the cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno _ by sight. 
Their contributions are nonetheless fascinating, and ``Fellini: I'm 
a Born Liar'' is best understood not as a biography but as a kind 
of master class, a seminar in aesthetics conducted by Fellini, with 
ample and intelligent footnotes supplied by Pettigrew. Fellini, impish 
and eloquent, tends to explain his art either through abstractions 
or discussions of technique. The art itself, however, is peerlessly, 
magically sensual, and when we hear him talk about memory, dreams, 
sexuality and fear it is helpful to see how these ideas have taken 
shape in his movies. In addition to scenes from Fellini's movies, 
Pettigrew revisits some of the locations where they were shot, as 
if to show the alchemical transformatioa puppeteer, a scientist, a 
painter and a deity. After seeing this film, you may not be content 
to take him at his word. Luckily, though, his films supply the proof. 
PRODUCTION NOTES: `FELLINI: I'm a Born Liar' Directed by Damian Pettigrew;

and Olivier Gal; director of photography, Paco Wiser; edited by Florence 
Ricard; released by First Look Pictures. Running time: 105 minutes.

c.2003 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE@ AMMAN, JORDA -- Alleged Iraqi plots 
to contaminate water supplies used by Jordanian and U.S. troops on 
the Iraqi border, and to bomb a hotel in Amman frequented by Western 
journalists have been thwarted in recent days, authorities said Tuesday. 
Jordanian and Western officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said that five Iraqi diplomats who have since been expelled from the 
country^@were behind the failed plan to spike the water line that 
runs from Zarqa, 17 miles northeast of Amman, to military bases in 
eastern Zo2lan where U.S. forces are in place. They added that four 
Iraqis arrested last week intended to bomb a luxury hotel. Western 
diplomats identified it as the Grand Hyatt in western Amman, where 
some 70 journalists are staying. Madian al-Jazerah, the Hyatt's marketing 
communications manager, said the hotel was unaware of the alleged 
plot. But other sources said the Iraqis set off a primitive incendiary 
bomb at the hotel's executive lounge. The flames were extinguished 
by the building's sprinkler system. The plans to target Americans 
come amid widespread hostility in Jordan to the war in Iraq and deep 
sensitivity over the U.S. military presence in the area. ``We are 
concerned about increased potential threats against American citizens 
here and worldwide,'' said Justin Ciberell, a U.S. Embassy spokesman 
in Amman. Tough new security measures have been put in place in recent 
weeks to ensure that popular opposition to the war among Jordanians 
does not spin out of control, including declaring the volatile Palestinian 
Bekaa refugee camp a closed military zone with access subject to government 
approval. Jordanian officials admit there are an unspecified number 
of U.S troops currently operating Patriot anti-missile units to defend 
jordan'{0qim a repeat of the Scud missile attacks launched against 
it during the 1991 Gulf War. But the government rejects claims made 
by Saddam Hussein's regime last month that Washington is using its 
territory or airfields along its eastern border as launching pads 
for operations in Iraq. ``Jordan is not a party to this conflict. 
There is no activity inside Jordan against Iraq,'' Prime Minister 
Ali Abu al-Ragheb said on Sunday. However, unmarked aircraft, including 
what appeared to be Chinook helicopters, F-16s and transport planes, 
werebspotted Monday flying across a newly created military zone near 
the Iraqi border, and there have also been sightings by locals of 
U.S. troops accompanied by Jordanian minders. American secret service 
officials, who operate out of a room marked ``press center'' at the 
Baghdad Cafe hotel in the border town of Ruweished, close to the military 
bases, on Sunday confiscated from a San Francisco Chronicle reporter 
film shot in the area. Experts and Western diplomats say Jordan has 
given logistical aid to U.S. special forces operating in western Iraq, 
and that Washington has used AWAC surveillance planes to launch air 
strikes in addition to manning the Patriot batteries. Jordan's heavy 
reliance on U.S. economic aid and its geographical position between 
Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia has put King Abdullah in a difficult 
position. The country is keen not to upset Washington as it did during 
the Gulf War, when King Hussein sided with the Iraqi dictator, and 
has decided not to support him publicly this time around. There is 
much at stake economically for Jordan. With the decimation of its 
tourist industry during the past 29 months of Israeli-Palestinian 
violence, widespread poverty and a jobless rate of around 16 percent, 
the kingdom is ill placed to weather the losses of around $2 billion 
-- one quarter of Jordan's GDP -- that analysts predict could result 
from the war in Iraq. Jordan is set to receive $700 million in economic 
aid, including $250 million to address its ``most pressing budgetary 
needs and debt service obligations'' as part of the $75 billion war 
budget President Bush proposed to Congress last Tuesday. Jordan would 
also receive $406 million in military aid subject to approval from 
Congress. New business opportunities could also come from the reconstruction 
of a post-Hussein Iraq. But Jordanian public opinion is vehemently 
anti-American, and openly voiced evmnemong members of Jordan's Press 
AssociaTmon, who this week took to the streets of the capital cha,ting 
anti-U.S. and anti-war slogans. Leith Shebilet, a Jordanian architect 
who is a prominent figure in the Islamic community, admitted to being 
``very, very sympathetic to Saddam'' and feeling ``betrayed'' by King 
Abdullah for allowing U.S. troops on Jordanian soil. Earlier this 
week, Shebilet was one of 99 well-known Jordanians, including four 
former prime ministers, who presented Abdullah with a statement warning 
him he was ``losing legitimacy'' with his pro-U.S. stance. Referring 
to public rage over the issue, Shebilet said, ``It may not blow up 
this month or next. But most certainly it's going to blow up, most 
certainly.''

Two illegal immigrants from Algeria were convicted on Tuesday of plotting 
to raise money for terror groups that the British police said included 
al-Qaida. Brahim Benmerzouga, 31, and Baghdad Meziane, 31, were found 
guilty after a five-day jury trial in Leicester Crown Court. Each 
was sentenced to 11 years in prison. They are the first people in 
Britain to be found guilty of being part of the Qaida network. The 
two had been arrested by antiterror police in an early morning raid 
on their home in the Midlands city two weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, 
suicide attacks in the United States. The police also captured Kamal 
Daoudi, who is accused of being an explosives and computer expert 
for al-Qaida and of helping to plan an attack on the U.S. Embassy 
in Paris. He was later extradited to France, where he awaits trial 
on terrorism charges with another Qaeda suspect, Djamel Beghal. The 
court heard that Benmerzouga and Meziane had helped run an international 
credit card fraud scheme intended to raise money for terror organizations 
like al-Qaida. The pair worked together in a local factory and used 
numerous false identities to hide their connection to terror cells 
across Europe. Benmerzouga possessed more than 60 films promoting 
suicide bombings and ``martyrdom,'' including 19 copies of a videotape 
of Osama bin Laden. Meziane had an elaborate forger's kit, terror 
camp recruitment material and a book called ``A Biography of the Freedom 
Fighter, Osama bin Laden.'' Coded information relating to the Sept. 
11 attacks was found on his computer. In the apartment, the police 
also discovered e-mail messages that talked of prices for ``washed'' 
and ``unwashed'' clothes, which were thought to refer to doctored 
travel documents. The pair collected the names and credit details 
of nearly 200 bank accounts on computer disks, which were found in 
their home and car. Other military training equipment and battlefield 
communications gear was also uncovered. Both men had confessed to 
forgery charges but had pleaded not guilty to ``entering into a funding 
arrangement for the purposes of terrorism,'' the charge under which 
they were sentenced on Tuesday. Sentencing the men, the judge, Richard 
Herbert Curtis, said: ``I appreciate that each of you has not personally 
injured anyone. You have both been convicted by the unanimous verdict 
of the jury of conspiracy to defraud in respect to banks and credit 
card companies and entering into a funding arrangement for the purposes 
of terrorism. ``You have not directly taken life or seriously injured 
anyone, but the terrorists, in order to carry out their terrible killings 
and maimings, need money, false papers and military style materials. 
``You both provided terrorists with the vital support and ran a well-organized 
and secretive cell.''

Madonna has withdrawn an antiwar video that was to promote her new 
single, ``American Life.'' It had been scheduled to have itsO premiere 
on Friday on the cable channel VH1, but on Monday night she decided 
not to release it. Madonna has marketed herself through controversy 
in the past. But at a time when an onstage remark against President 
Bush by Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks has led to a widespread 
radio boycott of the group, Madonna had second thoughts about the 
video. ``I have decided not to release my new video,'' she said in 
a statement. ``It was filmed before the war started, and I do not 
believe it is appropriate to air it at this time. Due to the volatile 
state of the world and out of sensitivity and respect to the armed 
forces, who I support and pray for, I do not want to risk offending 
anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video.'' There was 
plenty of room for interpretation. The song ``American Life'' is about 
dissatisfaction with stardom, but the video, filmed in early February, 
was full of military and battlefield imagery. In the version dated 
March 25, Madonna wore a form-fitting, quasi-military uniform, complete 
with dog tags. It featured a fashion show of skimpy clothing in camouflage 
pattern;1;4:477267226;2094730:477307203096095072077:42901067:3603214027 
9030479:0;42271015297873;ar planes. In the next sequence Madonna and 
dancers defaced a women's restroom, carving ``Protect Me'' into a 
wall. Close-ups showed Madonna singing with fiery explosions in the 
background. The clip then returned to the fashion show, intercut with 
pictures of bombardments. Madonna crashed a car through the backdrop 
onto the stage, hitting a model, and fired a water cannon at fashion 
photographers. This was intercut with scenes of artillery fire and 
bombing. In the final sequence Madonna tossed a grenade into the fashion-show 
audience, and it was caught by a George W. Bush look-alike, who flipped 
open its top to reveal it as a cigarette lighter and lighted a cigar 
with it. In an MTV News interview last Friday, she said the hand-grenade 
scene was ``really important.'' ``The one who catches it,'' she said, 
``takes something that could be violent and destructive and takes 
the destruction out of it by turning it into something else.''

Temperatures in Nebraska soared to almost 90 degrees Tuesday afternoon, 
while several hundred miles to the north, in eastern North Dakota, 
readings hovered in the upper 30s. These contrasting air masses were 
separated by two fronts wavering from the northern Rockies to the 
Northeast. Unseasonably warm weather will continue on Wednesday across 
the central and southern Plains. Plenty of sun will help temperatures 
rise well into the 80s, exceeding 90 degrees in ` bew spots. Brisk 
winds from the southwest will carry the warmth into the Ohio Valley 
and Middle Atlantic States. A potent disturbance will bring showers 
and mountain snow in the West. It will be cool, with temperatures 
10 to 20 degrees below normal. Snow showers, mixed with some sleet, 
will occur near the Canadian border from Montana to New England. FOCUS: 
APRIL TORNADOES May is the most active month for tornadoes in the 
United States, with an average of more than 160 twisters. But April 
holds the distinction of having more killer tornadoes. With the speedy 
jet stream continuing to derive energy from large north-to-south temperlains. 
Ahead of the system, humid air streams inland from increasingly warm 
waters of the Gulf of Mexico. When the potent disturbances meet high 
humidity, violent twisters can result.&lt;

British sticky toffee pudding is not what Americans would cql,(pudding: 
it is a moist ginger cake, soaked through with buttery caramel sauce. 
To help satisfy New Yorkers' infatuation with all things caramelized 
(consider creme brul%m and dulce de leche), sticky toffee pudding 
has made its way across the Atlantic and turned up on menus at Five 
Points, Craft and Blue Smoke. The best one is at Nicole's on East 
60th Street, in the New York outpost of the Bri|4622943729'41762 Farhi. 
The chef, Annie Wayte, serves puddings that come straight from the 
Mary Poppins nursery. The sticky toffee pudding has a tender crust 
and aHdeep-brown caramelized flavor. In season, Wayte uses fresh persimmons 
rather than the traditional dates to keep the cake moist. A good slosh 
of custard (usually instant) is the standard topping for puddings; 
at Nicole's, Wayte pours a creamy, vanilla-flecked custard sauce that 
smoothly counters the sugar and spice of the cake. STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING 
Adapted from Nicole's Time: 45 minutes 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, 
plus more for ramekins 6 ounces dates, pitted and roughly chopped 
1 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 cup granulated sugar 2 eggs, lightly beaten 
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon ground 
ginger 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves Pinch of salt 
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Vanilla custard (see note) Toffee 
sauce (see recipe). 1. Butter 4 large or 6 medium-size ramekins. Heat 
oven to 350 degrees. Combine dates and 1 1/4 cups water in a saucepan, 
and simmer until dates are soft, about 10 minutes. Add baking soda, 
and mix well; mixture wiLl voam up. 2. Cream 4 tablespoons butter 
and the sugar with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Beat in 
eggs. In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, cloves 
and salt. 3. Add date mixture and dry ingredients to butter mixture, 
a third of each at a time, and mix well. Add vanilla. Divide batter 
among ramekins, filling each no more than 3/4 full. 4. Place on a 
baking sheet, and bake 30 to 35 minutes, until just firm. Turn out 
hot puddings into serving bowls. Pour custard around each one, and 
pass the toffee sauce. Yield: 4 to 6 servings. Note: Bird's instant 
custard is available at www.britshoppe.com. TOFFEE SAUCE Time: 15 
minutes 1 1/2 cups sugar 6 ounces (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter 2 
cups heavy cream. Place 1/4 cup sugar in a heavy saucepan, and cook 
over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until sugar turns 
light brown. Add remaining sugar 1/4 cup at a time, allowing each 
batch to brown before adding next. When all sugar is in pan, keep 
cooking until it turns dark brown. Add butter, and stir until melted. 
Stir in cream, and heat through. Pour into a jug, and serve. Yield: 
4 to 6 servings.

Agnes Warner has seen three centuries, two Halley's comets _ actually, 
the same one twice _ and eight great-grandchildren. She led an all-women's 
band in Florida in the 1960s, when she answered to the name Toots. 
She played cornet and a wicked hand of bridge. But things have been 
a little quiet for the past 30 years for Warner, who dresses meticulously 
and has hair as white, fine and elegantly shaped as spun sugar. Her 
husband died in 1969, her band members followed and her back and short-term 
memory are causing her problems. So when Edie Barr, the recreation 
director of the Chelsea at East Brunswick, the assisted living facility 
where Warner now lives, asked what she wanted for her 105th birthday 
on March 27, her answer was at the ready: a date. ``She said she didn't 
want to get married, but she wouldn't mind a boyfriend,'' said Barr, 
who arranged for an article in The Home News Tribune, a local newspaper, 
about Warner, announcing that ``great-grandfathers are sought to vie 
for the opportunity to be her date for the evening.'' Last Thursday, 
on her birthday, four mature muffins sat in a row in the Chelsea's 
lobby, all clean-shaven, with red roses in their lapels, two with 
canes, and one wearing a herringbone jacket, plaid shirt and colorful 
knit vest. Decked out in big pearl clip-on earrings and a wrist corsage, 
Warner danced with each in order. There was Contestant No. 1, Michael 
V. Gonzalez, 94, who led her waltzing as ``Somewhere My Love'' was 
played on the baby grand piano. Bachelor No. 2 was George Zupeck, 
88, who retired 26 years ago from Squibb and urged Warner, ``Come 
on, get close,'' as he led her around the floor to ``Are You Lonesome 
Tonight?'' He had called the Chelsea after seeing the newspaper article, 
and his references were checked at the Elks lodge. ``They said, `He's 
a beautiful dancer, take him,' and they did,'' he said. And he was. 
Tom Fargin, 85, a former longshoremen's union representative in a 
gray suit and red tie, danced with Warner to ``Moon River.'' And from 
the Chelsea, there was Carl Mendola, 85, who waltzed with Warner to 
``Edelweiss.'' (She prefers the fox trot, her son, Russ Warner, who 
is 75, said later.) Between numbers, she rested in a wing chair decorated 
with roses and carnations, and Barr interviewed the men about how 
many great-grandchildren they have and their views on older women. 
After the dancing, Warner pushed her walker over to the piano and 
began playing for the crowd, as she often does during cocktail hour, 
which starts at 3:30 p.m. Though she complained that she did not remember 
the songs, she persevered, and the notes coalesced, haltingly, into 
melodies, her hands meeting in music familiar from the early part 
of the last century. She played ``Give My Regards to Broadway'' and 
``The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze.'' Zupeck asked canarylike 
vibrato as she played. After several songs, Barr reminded Warner that 
it was time to choose a bachelor. When Warner said, ``Oh, please don't 
ask me that, they were all very good,'' Barr resorted to an informal 
applause meter. Mendola, the home-team favorite, won hands down. Zupeck 
congratulated him. Warner fiddled with the buttons on her white cardigan. 
She played another old favorite on the piano, and the audience of 
about 40 residents caught up with her, singing ``You're a Grand Old 
Flag.'' Mendola was clearly pleased that he had carried the day. ``She's 
a wonderful woman, a very nice woman,'' he said. ``We speak well together, 
as if we'd known each other a long time.'' ``You are the winner, kid,'' 
Gonzalez told him. ``Thanks, Michael. You're No. 1.''- 0 Karen Popick, 
Mendola's granddaughter, said he had been excited by the dating game. 
``He got a specific outfit picked out,'' she said. ``It was adorable. 
He got his hair cut.'' Mendola called her ``my No. 1 granddaughter.'' 
He referred to Warner as ``my lady friend.'' Followed by relatives 
with video and still cameras, the couple proceeded to the private 
dining room, which featured six gold candles in a candelabra. ``Carl, 
you're going to have to carry the conversation,'' Barr said to him, 
as the couple approached the table. ``Sure,'' Mendola said. To Warner, 
he added, ``You're a lovely lady.'' ``I have a bad back,'' she said. 
``Sit back,'' he suggested. ``I'm getting old, you know,'' she said. 
``Never say you're getting old,'' he said. The choice of pork chops 
or scampi did not quite suit the birthday girl. ``Don't you have anything 
I like?'' Warner asked the waitress. When her son tried to order her 
a sandwich, she revolted. ``Cream cheese and jelly?'' Warner said. 
``Oh God, I have that every day of my life.'' They decided on chicken 
for her, with milk and a salad. When her glass arrived she raised 
it and said, ``Here's good luck to you, sir.'' Mendola was busy with 
his pork chops and did not hear. He wore his room key on a yellow 
phone-cord bracelet, and it clicked on the plate. They ate in silence. 
``You don't talk much at the table, is that your way?'' she said. 
``Not that it matters. You got a wife?'' ``She passed away in 1987,'' 
he said. ``That's OK,'' she said. ``For this, I've been a widow for 
a long time.'' Before dessert, the couple were left to their own devices. 
Whatever their conversation, they kept it to themselves. Warner's 
son reported, after discreet questioning, that a good-night kiss had 
not occurred between his mother and her date. &lt;

Rebecca Nakabazzi's son Julius is going to become an AIDS orphan. 
Right now the shy 11-year-old lives at home with his mother, who is 
frail and feverish but still very much a doting mother. But all too 
soon, _ it could be weeks or months or even years _ she will die and 
the number of AIDS orphans in Africa, estimated at 11 million, will 
increase by one. Nakabazzi is taking no chances when it comes to Julius' 
memory of her. During her remaining time with her son, she is preparing 
a book of memories that she hopes he will treasure throughout his 
life. ``I want you to study and to go to university and to be responsible,'' 
Nakabazzi, a 30-year-old former hairdresser and seamstress now too 
sick to work, has written in her book, advice she wants him to remember 
when she is not here to deliver it in person. Borrowing an idea from 
cancer patients in Britain, health workers in Uganda are urging dying 
parents like Nakabazzi to preserve memories for their children. Part 
photo album and part diary, memory books are becoming an increasingly 
popular way for dying Africans to continue coddling their beloved 
offspring from the grave. Since Uganda adopted memory books in the 
mid-1990s, hundreds have been passed on to newly orphaned children. 
The idea has spread to neighboring Kenya and to other countries throughout 
a continent hit hard by AIDS, where tradition is often handed down 
face to face through stories and songs and ceremonies. AIDS has interrupted 
that pattern all too often, leaving many youngsters with shaky cultural 
roots. Many of Africa's orphans, and there are more on this continent 
than anywhere else, have only the vaguest memories of their lost parents, 
if they remember them at all. They do not know their birthplaces. 
At tender ages the children are shunted off to relatives, orphanages 
or foster families, with many siblings separated in the process. In 
the worst cases, children are left to fend for themselves. The memories 
they hold on to can be unpleasant ones. The parents the orphans keep 
in their heads may be weak skeletons barely able to function, who 
drift off into perpetual sleep. ``I accept that I'm going to die,'' 
Nakabazzi said one recent morning, propping herself up in bed while 
Julius was off at school on the outskirts of this city, Uganda's capital. 
``I've come to realize that it's a normal thing. We're all going to 
die. For me, though, it will happen while Julius is still young.'' 
So she uses the book to tell him the things she wants him to remember 
_ life lessons, a mother's impressions and a family history that he 
may be too young to absorb fully just now. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Writing 
in Luganda, the country's major indigenous language, and English, 
she recounts her own childhood and that of Julius' father, who died 
when Julius was 2, also of AIDS. She tells Julius where he was born 
and when he took his first steps. Her deep religious convictions come 
out in the form of Bible verses. ``You resembled your father and at 
the same time me, so you are a mirror of both of us,'' she writes 
to the boy, reminding him that he loves to watch wrestling on television. 
``You are supportive,'' she says on a page devoted to things she loves 
about him. ``You would ask: `Are you sick? You're not feeling well? 
Sorry.' '' She includes photographs of Julius' childhood and the family 
he might otherwise not remember so well. There is his father standing 
by Julius' side and other smiling relatives, who have also died of 
AIDS. There is a photograph of Juliusooks themselves are ordinary 
binders with plastic pages that allow written messages, photographs 
or anything else with sentimental value to be stuck inside. But there 
is nothing ordinary about the contents. They capture the ups and downs 
of difficult lives, poor families struggling to get by only to be 
overcome by the devastation of a cruel disease. Putting together such 
a book can be an all-encompassing task, often taking every spare moment 
until that time when the ownership of the book shifts to the child. 
It can be emotionally draining. It requires a great deal of thought. 
Tracking down photographs and anecdotes from relatives takes energy 
that AIDS patients have in short supply. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Parents 
who have completed the memory books say the process can be joyful 
as one recalls long-forgotten memories, but sad as well, as one confronts 
the fact that death is looming. AIDS sufferers are encouraged to disclose 
their disease to their children, which can be more than many parents 
can bear. But the books can mean so much to the children left behind. 
Losing one's parents is always traumatic, but advocates of the books 
say they can help reduce the emotional void orphans face in the future, 
even if their own futures are also cut short by the virus, as is often 
the case. Julius himself has been diagnosed with the virus that causes 
AIDS. AIDS organizations offer training classes before encouraging 
patients to begin the process. They discuss ``permanent separation,'' 
a euphemism for death. They try to break down the stigma still associated 
with the disease, despite its widespread nature. They also underscore 
that people ought to prepare for death. ``You can't leave your children 
with half-baked information from your deathbed,'' said Dorothy Namutamba, 
a Ugandan who teaches seminars on memory books for the National Community 
of Women Living with HIV and AIDS. ``You must prepare when you're 
still strong enough. Don't wait until you're so weak you can't open 
your lips.'' At a recent training session on the books held in western 
Uganda, those taking part were urged to write wills and designate 
guardians so the children know who is going to raise them when they 
become parentless. Memory books, as well, ought to be begun well before 
death is looming. ``When we die, a lot of memories can fade away with 
us,'' Nakabazzi said, pausing frequently and rubbing her head. ``The 
family history can disappear. I want Julius to always remember his 
mother.''

A former chief executive of the Shell Oil Co. appears to be the leading 
contender to oversee the Iraqi oil industry after the fall of Saddam 
Hussein, industry experts who had spoken to the Bush administration 
said on Tuesday. Those experts said the administration was still developing 
a plan for American involvement in the Iraqi oil sector, whose fields 
and facilities are dilapidated but whose employees are widely respected 
for thwir pron, and that someone else would probably be named to run 
the refining and marketing of Iraqi oil. After leaving Shell, Carroll 
went to run the giant construction company Fluor Corp. He retired 
from Fluor in February, 2002, and now Fluor, which is based in Aliso 
Viejo, Calif., confirmed recently that it was invited by the administration 
to bid on reconstruction work in Iraq, though it is unclear whether 
the company has been awarded any contracts. The Bush administration 
has long insisted that the sale of Iraqi oil will benefit the Iraqis 
themselves. But reviving the Iraqi oil industry, under the scrutiny 
of a skeptical world and the Iraqis themselves, will be a formidable 
task, industry experts said. The administration and Carroll declined 
to comment on the possibility of hisap`ointment to the oil post. If 
the administration does tap Carroll, it will be relying on a career 
oil man who thrives on challenges, industry analysts said. Many analysts 
credit Carroll for reshaping Shell Oil, the American arm of Royal 
Dutch/Shell group, when he ran it in the 1990s, mainly by pushing 
the company to develop large reservoirs of oil and natural gas in 
the risky but potentially rich deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 
At Fluor, Carroll quickly got rid of unprofitable old businesses and 
found promising new ones, said Michael S. dudqs, engineering analyst 
for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Dudas said Carroll was known for pulling 
together competent people to carry out major restructuring plans without 
micromanaging them, a trait that would serve him well if the administration 
decides to let the Iraqis control their oil. ``He would get very good 
people, and check in with them frequently,'' Dudas said. ``He would 
put the plan in place but he would let them run with it.''

The US-led war on Iraq might finally solve the national mystery that 
for a dozen years has darkened the tranquility of this sun- and oil-drenched 
emirate. There are 605 Kuwaitis who never returned home and were never 
accounted for, after being taken prisoner by Iraq during its brief 
invasion of Kuwait. The open question of their fate in a desert nation 
smaller than New Jersey is perhaps even more deeply felt here than 
the issue of Vietnam War POWs and MIAs has been in the United States. 
Families of the prisoners of war are anxiously awaiting the news of 
their loved ones that is expected to come with the presumptive fall 
of Baghdad. Even if they are dead, most will be grateful to have an 
answer after more than a decade of questions. But many cling to the 
possibility that some of the missing are still alive. The US forces 
massing outside Baghdad have prompted hopes of reunification but also 
fears that the prisoners might be used as human shields or killed 
as a last-ditch act of cruelty by Saddam Hussein's regime. On the 
eve of war, Latifa Ibrahim Swaidan, an ailing 68=y%ir-old widow, had 
a dream about her missing daughter, Daad Omar al-Harini. In the dream 
al-Harini was healthy, smiling, and surrounded by bright white sheets. 
``Either I'm going to see her again on white sheets, or that was her 
burial shroud,'' said Swaidan. Some 7,000 Kuwaitis _ sometimes whole 
families at a time _ were detained and taken to Iraq during the occupation 
by Hussein's forces in 1990 and 1991, according to Abdul Hamid al-Attar, 
a senior official with the National Committee for Missing and POW 
Affairs. Most of them were civilians accused of resisting the Iraqi 
occupation. Often, like al-Harini, they were simply in the wrong place 
at the wrong time. The majority of the prisoners were released either 
through the intervention of the Red Cross or under the cease fire 
that ended the Gulf War. Yet some people simply never materialized. 
``We waited several months. We waited for an answer _ where were the 
rest?'' said al-Attar, whose son is a POW. ``And the answer came from 
Saddam Hussein _ I don't have any more.'' Iraqi senior officials, 
saying they released all of their prisoners of war, have never cooperated 
with efforts to locate them _ although they reopened talks a few months 
ago, in an apparent attempt to win public support for heading off 
a US invasion of Iraq. Al-Harini was a 32-year-old mother of three 
when she disappeared. As a Lebanese national, she had less reason 
to be fearful in leaving the house than did Kuwaiti citizens during 
the occupation. So one day she brought some food supplies to Kuwaiti 
neighbors. She had been in their house for 15 minutes when Iraqi soldiers 
barged in and arrested word of her since. Al-Harini's husband remarried 
and moved to the United States with the children. It is an option 
not availaand's death. Over the past 12 years, the POW issue has been 
woven deeply into the Kuwaiti national psyche. Flags and banners wave 
as constant reminders, though few need much reminding. Kuwait has 
a population of 2.1 million with only 800,000 of them Kuwaiti citizens, 
so most every national has some personal connection to the cause. 
``Everybody in Kuwait, every house, The prisoners who were released 
from Iraqi jails came back with harrowing tales of torture. ``I've 
never told this to anyone,'' Swaidan said. ``I would rather that she 
had died back then than that she survive every day a thousand deaths.'' 
Still, many have dreams that their family members will one day return. 
As bad as it looks, one thing that gives them hope is the fact that 
Iraq denied for years that it held thousands of prisoners of war from 
the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war _ until it re.leased at least some of 
them. Last month, Iraq freed more than 250 Iranian prisoners, and 
Iran turned over nearly 400. The Kuwaiti government plans to press 
the issue in other ways. The matter of the missing Kuwaitis has been 
placed on the United Nation Security Council calendar for discussion 
later this month. Al-Attar's son, Jamal, a 26-year-old radio engineer, 
was accused of serving in the resistance movement. The day Jamal was 
captured, his father and sisters went to the police station looking 
for him. Even though al-Attar saw his son's Jeep Suzuki, the guard 
denied they had the young man in custody. ``You want your son or the 
car?'' taunted one officer. Then al-Attar heard Jamal say, ``No father, 
I'm here, don't believe them.'' One of the sisters came running, and 
the guard fired warning shots at her feet. The family fled, and when 
al-Attar returned a few hours later, he was told his son had been 
transferred. ``From then until today _ that was the last thing we 
knew of him,'' al-Attar said. ``I can't tell you how much I miss him.''

North America's sawfish population has dwindled almost to extinction. 
The odd-looking cousins of stingrays with toothy snouts were caught 
in commercial nets and killed by anglers who wanted to keep their 
``saws'' as trophies. Over-harvesting, combined with a loss of habitat 
and a slow system of reproduction _ sawfish become sexually mature 
around age 15 and give live birth to 12 to 15 pups every other year 
_ led to an estimated population loss of 95 percent during the past 
century. On Tuesday, the National Marine Fisheries Service listed 
the smalltooth sawfish as endangered under the Endangered Species 
Act, making it the first elasmobranch (sharks and other cartilaginous 
fish) and the first truly saltwater fish on the list. Other fish on 
the federal list, such as the Gulf sturgeon and the shortnose sturgeon, 
spend parts of their lives in fresh water. ``With this listing we 
hope that people will become more aware of this vulnerable sawfish 
and will help in our efforts to save it for future generations,'' 
said Bill Hogarth, assistant administrator for the fisheries service. 
Fisheries service scientists are working with scientists from Mote 
Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, The Ocean Conservancy and the Florida 
Marine Research Institute on a management plan for sawfish. Part of 
the plan will designate critical habitat for sawfish, which could 
lead to restrictions on boaters in parts of Everglades National Park. 
Young sawfish live on shallow flats that protect them from sharks 
and other predators that lurk in deeper water. The habitat needs of 
sawfish in other stages of their lives remains largely unknown. During 
the late 1800s, sawfish were common on both coasts of Florida and 
ranged as far north as Chesapeake Bay and throughout the Gulf of Mexico. 
An Indian River Lagoon fisherman reported catching 300 sawfish in 
nets during a single season in the 1880s. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 
sawfish remain, most of them in Everglades National Park. Florida 
regulators outlawed the sale and harvest of sawfish in 1992. The constitutional 
amendment that limited net fishing in Florida waters in 1995 further 
reduced the unintended killing of sawfish in nets, but the slow-to-mature 
sawfish remained in danger. In 1999, The Ocean Conservancy petitioned 
federal regulators to list the sawfish under the Endangered Species 
Act. ``It's sad to think it will take about a century to rebuild them, 
but this is likely the most important first step forward,'' said Sonja 
Fordham, a shark conservation specialist for The Ocean Conservancy. 
Fordham said she hopes the endangered species listing will encourage 
other nations to protect sawfish. The smalltooth sawfish in Florida 
is one of seven species found worldwide. ``They're in trouble everywhere 
they live,'' Fordham said. Willie Howard writes for The Palm Beach

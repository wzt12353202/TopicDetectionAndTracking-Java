The U.S. naval base at Rota in southern Spain will double the size 
of its hospital facilities to 250 beds to handle expected casualties 
from the war in Iraq. ``We need to prepare for a great number of casualties'' 
even if they don't materialize, commanding officer Captain P.J. Kelly 
said. ``That's just prudent.'' More than 50 soldiers have passed through 
the naval and air base, most in the past week since fighting in Iraq 
began March 20. About 35 were non-combat related, Kelly said. The 
rest were ``gunshot and shrapnel wounds _ very typical stuff.'' On 
Monday, reporters were allowed onto the base, which Spain owns and 
shares with the United States, to meet officers and interview naval 
corpsman 3rd class Carlos Cordova, who was recovering from a shrapnel 
wound to his right forearm. A week ago, Cordova was helping load an 
automatic grenade launcher when a mortar round struck nearby. ``The 
piece of shrapnel that cut my arm went into my buddy's shoulder behind 
me,'' said the 24-year-old native of Sugarland, Texas. The firefight 
took place near the southern city of Nasiriyah on what he described 
as a routine security patrol. Headed home to recover, Cordova sounded 
a bit disappointed he wouldn't be returning to his unit or seeing 
more of Iraq. ``It's not a bad-looking country except for all the 
ordnance lying around,'' he said. The U.S. Naval Station in Rota has 
a 116-bed hospital unit, built for the war in Iraq, that will be mothballed 
when the new 250-bed facility is ready, in about 10 days. Both are 
housed in specially equipped tents. The new one will be expandable 
to 500 beds and care is expected to be as good as that provided at 
the long-established U.S. armed forces facility at Landstuhl, Germany. 
``We have all the skills,'' Capt. Kelly said. He said neither facility 
would treat victims of chemical or biological assault because facilities 
have already been set up in the Middle East and it's imperative soldiers 
get treatment as fast as possible. (ewm/dw-par-eg)

Riding a wave of anti-American sentiment, outlawed Islamic extremist 
organizations that were routed by the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan 
in 2001 are making a comeback. Recruitment in Pakistan of potential 
terrorists appears to be on the rise. Militant leaders freed from 
house arrest have returned to the mosques to rally the faithful against 
the United States. Muslim radicals are feeding on anger over the war 
in Iraq to regroup and revitalize, raising the threat of more anti-U.S. 
terrorism around the world. ``They are defiant. They are angry. More 
and more people are angry,'' said Abu Mujahed, a militant whose name 
is a nom de guerre. He said new recruits are being found by way of 
Internet chat rooms that deal with the war on Iraq and ``American 
aggression.'' Analysts say the Iraq war is emboldening militants, 
who believe the United States is distracted by the fighting. ``Militants 
know that the United States is fully engaged in Iraq and that has 
diluted their focus on the war on terror,'' said Riffat Hussein, a 
political analyst. ``The militants feel the government will not maintain 
as close a watch on them because the American pressure to keep down 
or stop all together the activities of militants is off.'' The war 
also is squeezing Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, a key U.S. 
ally in the war in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida 
network and the former Taliban regime. Musharraf's support for Washington 
must be balanced against two powerful forces at home. One is the army, 
dominated by religious conservatives who were reluctant about the 
U.S. war in Afghanistan and who now staunchly oppose the war in Iraq. 
The second are elements within the Pakistan intelligence agency still 
closely allied to Islamic militants. Old militant groups, outlawed 
as terrorist groups, have re-emerged under new guises and operate 
openly as ``political'' groups. Jaish-e-Mohammed is now Khudam-ul 
Islam, Harakat-ul Mujahedeen's new name is Jamiat-ul Ansar, and Lashkar-e-Tayyaba 
is now called Jamaat-e-Dawa. Other Muslim countries face a similar 
surge of support for violent movements: Egypt, Jordan, Yemen and Saudi 
Arabia, to name those most friendly toward the United States. In Egypt, 
the banned Muslim Brotherhood, which wants to transform the country 
into an Islamic state, is gaining exposure at anti-U.S. protests on 
a scale rarely seen in Cairo. Dia'a Rashwan, an expert on radical 
Islamic groups at Egypt's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic 
Studies, said he has noticed a trend as he navigated Web sites and 
chat rooms in recent days. ``Now we have many calls to jihad, and 
those calls aren't only coming from what we usually call radicals 
or extremists,'' he said. More moderate clerics are using such language, 
as are Islamic thinkers who usually confine themselves to political 
analysis, not calls to arms, he said. In Afghanistan, where U.S. troops 
are still pursuing Taliban and al-Qaida holdouts, the Taliban's supreme 
leader Mullah Mohammed Omar is circulating posters of his fresh decree 
calling for a holy war against the United States. The signatures of 
600 Muslim clerics are attached. Mullah Omar's old regime has shored 
up its alliances with remnants of al-Qaida and fighters loyal to rebel 
commander Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Already, an increase is noticeable 
in attacks on U.S. forces, international peacekeepers and nongovernment 
organizations. There are only two camps left in the world today, says 
the decree from the one-eyed mullah who dominated Afghanistan for 
seven years: ``One is Islam, which is a religion of peace and the 
other symbol is Bush, who is a symbol of terror and hatred.''

New fighting killed one villager and three Muslim rebels, while three 
soldiers and 10 civilians were injured in clashes in the southern 
Philippines, the military said Tuesday. Guerrillas from the Moro Islamic 
Liberation Front torched several houses and a Roman Catholic chapel 
Monday before fleeing the village of Katipunan in Lanao del Norte 
province, said local army spokesman Maj. Julieto Ando. Village militiamen 
fought the rebels for about an hour before the guerrillas fled, leaving 
one villager dead and nine other people injured. In Midsayap, North 
Cotabato province, a platoon of soldiers fought about 50 MILF guerrillas 
for 30 minutes Monday before the rebels withdrew, leaving three of 
their comrades dead. Three army engineers and the wife of another 
soldier were injured early Tuesday as the rebels fired rocket-propelled 
grenades at an army engineering brigade's headquarters at Matanog 
town in Maguindanao province. Maj. Gen. Generoso Senga, commander 
of the 6th Infantry Division, denounced the rebel attack on the army 
engineers, who were asleep at the time. ``They should not be harmed 
because they are there to make projects _ roads, bridges _ for the 
people of Matanog, whether MILF or not,'' he said on DXMS radio. MILF 
vice chairman for military affairs, Al Haj Murad, said in a separate 
interview that the army engineers were legitimate targets because 
they are soldiers. He also justified rebel attacks on villages in 
which the military has established militia or army outposts, and said 
civilians were not targets. Murad's statement came after Muslim rebels 
earlier Monday had attacked two farming villages in North Cotabato 
province, wounding 12 civilians and taking eight others hostage. Hours 
later, the hostages were released unharmed after their mayor urged 
the rebels to set them free. Government and rebel representatives 
agreed in Malaysia last week to resume peace talks suspended two years 
ago. But Defense Secretary Angelo Reyes said that the military would 
continue to pursue rebels who violated laws.

The World Economic Forum said Tuesday it has postponed until fall 
a Beijing meeting of business and government leaders because participants 
were concerned about a deadly new flu-like disease. ``There's been 
a lot of concerns voiced by our participants about international and 
regional travel,'' said Pamela Mar, associate director for China at 
the Geneva-based organization. Mar said the Forum reached its decision 
after ``prudent'' consultations with the World Health Organization 
and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control about the spread of the disease, 
severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. ``We don't want our participants 
to feel they're having to jeopardize their safety to attend,'' Mar 
said. The meeting had been set for April 14-15. ``It's especially 
because so many of our participants are coming from within China and 
as well Hong Kong and Singapore, which have been very heavily hit,'' 
she said. ``People are just not feeling that comfortable about getting 
on airplanes.'' More than 1,600 people are believed infected with 
SARS worldwide, and more than 60 have died. Chinese officials last 
week acknowledged at least 34 deaths from the illness _ 31 of them 
in the southern province of Guangdong, where the disease is believed 
to have originated. ``It's difficult for us in good faith to have 
a summit where there's any chance or any risk or people feeling that 
it's dangerous to be there,'' Mar said. The meeting was intended to 
be the first major opportunity for the world business community to 
get to know the new leaders of China following changes by the National 
People's Congress. Also attending are to be top officials of the World 
Trade Organization, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development and 
other international bodies, as well as from selected countries, Mar 
said. A new date, tentatively expected in September or October, will 
be set following consultations with the participants, Mar said. The 
World Intellectual Property Organization, the U.N. agency to protect 
copyrights and patents, said Tuesday it was considering whether to 
postpone an April 24-26 meeting in Beijing. The meeting, billed as 
a ``summit'' with national leaders from different countries, expected 
to attend, is to discuss ``intellectual property and the knowledge 
economy.'' ``We are talking to the Chinese and assessing the situation,'' 
said spokeswoman Samar Shamoon, adding that the agency would probably 
make an announcement later this week. ^ (nk-agh-jf) &lt;

Japanese fans and former players gave Hideki Matsui a passing mark 
Tuesday after the New York Yankees' outfielder picked up a hit in 
his major league debut. Matsui got off to an impressive start, hitting 
an RBI single in his first major league at-bat against Toronto. He 
finished 1-for-4 as the Yankees beat the Blue Jays 8-4. ``It was a 
nice hit to left,'' said former Yomiuri Giants outfielder Wally Yonamine. 
``I thought he was a little anxious in some at-bats and could have 
waited a little more but he'll be fine. He's a good hitter.'' Matsui 
is one of Japan's most famous power hitters, hitting 332 homers in 
10 seasons in Japan, including 50 last year for the Giants. Former 
Yomiuri player and manager Shigeo Nagashima also liked what he saw. 
``Not a bad start,'' said Nagashima, who provided color commentary 
on NHK's live broadcast of the game. ``It was a relief to see him 
get his first hit and I'm looking forward to the next game.'' How 
many homers Matsui will be able to hit this season has been widely 
debated in the Japanese media with predictions ranging anywhere from 
20 to 40. ``I hope he doesn't worry too much about the homers,'' added 
Yonamine. ``Facing new pitchers, it'll be hard for him the first time 
around the league and he should just concentrate on hitting .300.'' 
Fans who skipped school or took a day off work to watch Matsui's first 
game were content with the base hit. ``It was a great hit,'' said 
student Kento Usuda, who watched the game on a giant screen at the 
Baseball Cafe next to Matsui's old home, the Tokyo Dome. ``He was 
hitting for the team, not trying to do anything fancy.'' Matsui came 
up with runners on first and third and two outs in the first inning 
against Roy Halladay. He hit a hard grounder through the left side 
of the infield to drive in Derek Jeter with the Yankees' first run 
of the season. A huge ovation erupted at the Baseball Cafe when the 
ball skidded past third baseman Eric Hinske and into left field. ``He 
went with the pitch and it was clutch hitting,'' said Hideki Yasuoka, 
a restaurant worker who took a day off to watch the game. ``I think 
he'll be able to hit about 30 homers this season and hit .300.''

MADRID, Spain (AP) _ U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Ruud Lubbers 
says he does not plan to lower the estimate of 600,000 refugees expected 
from Iraq even though only a trickle of people had fled the country 
since the American and British invasion began. ``So far, only a few 
thousand have knocked on the door but this is no surprise,'' Lubbers 
told a news conference Monday. ``Refugees don't come at the beginning 
of a war. They only start arriving as the crisis wears on, when there 
are scarcities of food and water and internal divisions begin.'' Lubbers 
said that in many cases people flee their countries even after a political 
settlement has been reached. The commissioner was in Madrid this week 
for talks with conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, one of 
the strongest supporters of the U.S. and British attacks on Iraq. 
Spain has sent some 9,000 troops and equipment to the Gulf region 
for what it describes as humanitarian operations. Lubbers said he 
would have favored trying to avoid military action. ``But some permanent 
members of the Security Council preferred to disagree,'' he said. 
``They sidelined the U.N. and preferred to go for military intervention.'' 
The UNHCR has budgeted a total of $US153 million to deal with a projected 
600,000 refugees from Iraq over six months. He compared the figure 
with the $US195 million budgeted for both refugee and repatriation 
programs in Afghanistan for an entire year. Commenting on the possible 
length of the war against Iraq, Lubbers said, ``I don't think all 
the problems will be resolved in a single month.'' He said the UNHCR 
began preparations for the refugee influx several months ago by holding 
talks with Iraq's neighbors, most notably Iran and Syria. At the moment, 
they are prepared to deal with some 300,000 refugees. The commissioner 
said that any leftover money would be used to help with the repatriation 
of between 500,000 and 1 million Iraqi exiles hoping to return home 
after the war. (cg-eg)

Valencia has renewed left back Amedeo Carboni's contract, keeping 
him at the club beyond his 39th birthday, news reports said Tuesday. 
Carboni, who turns 38 on Sunday, is the Spanish league's third oldest 
player. Deportivo de La Coruna's 40-year-old central defender Donato 
is the most senior while Mallorca left back Miquel Soler is a month 
older than Carboni. The former Italian international, who joined the 
club from AS Roma in 1997, was a key member of the Valencia team which 
won the Spanish league title last season for the first time in 31 
years. He played in Valencia's Champions League final defeat in 2001, 
when he missed a penalty in the shoot-out loss to Bayern Munich. Valencia 
announced last month that its other old-timer, 37-year-old Yugoslav 
international defender Miroslav Djukic, would be leaving the club 
in June.

The Iraq war has cost Israel nearly US$200 million so far, including 
production losses and security preparations, reports said Tuesday. 
The Manufacturers Association of Israel said the economy lost about 
US$64.3 million in the first two days of the war, primarily because 
many Israelis did not report to work amid concerns that Saddam Hussein 
would attack Israel with Scud missiles, as he did in the 1991 Gulf 
War. In addition, the callup of 11,000 reserve soldiers since the 
start of the war is costing Israel nearly US$110 million, the Israeli 
daily Yediot Ahronot said. Israel also told residents to open their 
gas mask kits, which will cost an additional US$17.1 million because 
the filters _ which have a limited life span once opened _ will now 
have to be replaced, the newspaper reported. These figures don't take 
into account the costs of vaccinating thousands of rescue and health 
officials against small pox or sealing rooms in schools and other 
public buildings. ^ rpm-kl

Tokyo stocks posted marginal gains on bargain hunting Tuesday. The 
U.S. dollar was lower against the yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock 
Average rose 14.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to end trading at 7,986.72. 
On Monday, the index lost 307.45 points, or 3.71 percent. It lost 
27.7 percent of its value over fiscal 2002, which ended Monday. The 
dollar bought 118.04 yen at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), down 0.98 yen from 
late Monday in Tokyo but above the 118.14 yen in late New York trading 
overnight. The currency traded from 117.78 yen and 118.44 yen in Tokyo. 
On the stock market, the benchmark Nikkei index eked out gains in 
a seesaw session marking the first day of Japan's fiscal year. Blue 
chips Honda Motor, Toyota Motor, TDK, Japan Telecom and NTT DoCoMo 
led the rebound, which traders attributed to bargain hunting following 
a dizzying drop Monday of almost 4 percent. ``The market rebounded 
on adjustment as yesterday was overdone,'' said Masatsugu Okeya, general 
manager at Chuo Securities. Market sentiment remained subdued, however, 
as investors were discouraged by growing pessimism over the prospects 
for the war in Iraq. A central bank survey released Tuesday morning 
showed business sentiment among major Japanese manufacturers worsened 
in the January-March quarter as worries grew that falling stock prices 
and the war in Iraq may hurt economic recovery. Volume on the first 
section was estimated at 863.83 million shares, up from 715.09 million 
shares Monday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 734 to 611, with 161 
issues unchanged. The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index closed up 0.96 
points, or 0.12 percent, to 788.96. The TOPIX, which includes all 
first-section issues, closed down 29.92 points, or 3.66 percent, Monday. 
In currencies, the dollar was under pressure amid continued worries 
over the U.S. economy and uncertainty about the war in Iraq. The euro 
bought US$1.0904 Tuesday late Tuesday in Tokyo, up from US$1.0874 
late Monday. Against the yen, the euro traded at 128.64 yen, down 
from 129.40 yen. The yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year government 
bond slipped to 0.6900 percent from 0.7000 percent late Monday. Its 
price rose 0.09 to 101.02. _ _ _ On the Net: Japan's Tokyo Stock Exchange:

American soldiers on the road to Baghdad fought bloody street-to-street 
battles with Iraqi forces loyal to Saddam Hussein while tense troops 
in southern Iraq shot and killed seven women and children when the 
driver of a van failed to stop at a checkpoint. The civilian deaths, 
following days of ambush attacks, may damage coalition efforts to 
win over the Iraqi people. U.S.-led forces launched missiles early 
Tuesday toward Baghdad and the holy Shiite Muslim city of Karbala 
to the southwest, and circling warplanes bombed targets in the area. 
Buildings in the capital shuddered in some of the strongest blasts 
since the air war began March 20. The night sky glowed orange and 
smoke billowed from the Old Palace presidential compound. Rumbling 
explosions, including a massive boom at 9 a.m., could be heard throughout 
the morning. Among the targets, U.S. officials said allied planes 
struck a complex that serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic 
Committee, where Iraqi dissidents say Saddam's son Odai runs a torture 
center. The coalition has relentlessly targeted Republican Guard positions 
in and around Baghdad in preparation for the war's likely decisive 
battle. U.S. forces battled some of these fighters from Iraq's best-trained 
units Monday in the Euphrates River town of Hindiyah, about 50 miles 
(80 kilometers) south of the capital. Troops seized tons of ammunition 
and hundreds of weapons at the local headquarters of Saddam's Baath 
Party, along with maps showing Iraqi military positions and the expected 
route of the U.S. attack. Other units fought to isolate Najaf to the 
south and prevent attacks on U.S. supply lines. A series of ruse attacks 
by militants in civilian clothes _ including a suicide bombing that 
killed four soldiers over the weekend _ have made the trek north increasingly 
dangerous for coalition troops. Monday's fatal shooting happened at 
a U.S. Army checkpoint near Najaf, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) 
north of Saturday's suicide attack. Coalition officials said soldiers 
motioned for an approaching van to stop, but the driver ignored them. 
Troops fired warning shots, to no avail, before shooting into the 
engine, then into the passenger compartment as a last resort, according 
to a statement from U.S. Central Command, which oversees the war in 
Iraq. The van was carrying 13 women and children, and seven were killed, 
the statement said. But The Washington Post, whose reporter is traveling 
with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division, said 15 people were in the 
vehicle and 10 were killed, including five small children. The newspaper 
described the vehicle as a four-wheel-drive Toyota crammed with the 
Iraqis' personal belongings. In its account of the shooting, the Post 
quoted an Army captain as saying the checkpoint crew did not fire 
the warning shots quickly enough. Central Command said initial reports 
indicated the soldiers had acted properly. A spokesman blamed the 
deaths on the Iraqi regime's guerrilla tactics and its practice of 
using women and children as shields. ``The most horrendous thing about 
this is that this is the result of what is apparently the strategy 
of the regime to challenge us at checkpoints, which has caused us 
to be on our toes and ensure that these are not suicide bombers,'' 
said Navy Capt. Frank Thorp. ``So the blood of this incident is on 
the regime of Saddam Hussein.'' The shooting is likely to stoke opposition 
to the U.S.-led invasion among Iraqis in the Shiite region, where 
Washington had hoped for a popular uprising against Saddam's Sunni 
Muslim government. Coalition troops moving north toward Baghdad have 
focused much of their energy on rooting out fighters with the ruling 
Baath Party militia and the Fedayeen _ Saddam's most trusted paramilitary 
militia. But they have also distributed rations to civilians, and 
they say winning over the Iraqi people is a priority. Coalition strikes 
have knocked out nearly all telephone service in the capital and Iraqi 
state-run television was briefly bombed off the air Monday. Iraqi 
TV later aired footage of Saddam and his sons Odai and Qusai, but 
there was no way of determining when the video was shot. Gen. Peter 
Pace, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on PBS television 
that U.S. intelligence sources have been unable to confirm that Saddam 
survived the March 19 strike on a bunker where he was believed to 
be staying but said, ``That doesn't mean he's dead.'' U.S. President 
George W. Bush warned Monday that Saddam ``may try to bring terror 
to our shores.'' The United States is acting to prevent such threats, 
he said, while offering assurances that the war remains on track. 
``Day by day we are moving closer to victory,'' he said. In northern 
Iraq, commanders said forces searching the recently captured compound 
of Muslim extremist group Ansar al-Islam found documents, computer 
discs and other material belonging to Arab fighters _ including suspected 
militants living in the United States. The Bush administration has 
longed claimed Ansar is linked to the al-Qaida terrorist network, 
but there has been no indication it has ties to Saddam's regime. Elsewhere, 
an Iraqi prisoner was shot to death after he reached for a Marine's 
weapon while being questioned, Central Command spokesman Lt. Cmdr. 
Charles Owen said Tuesday. He had no other details. The official casualty 
count for Americans stands at 44 dead, seven captured and 16 missing. 
The British death toll rose to 26 with the death of a soldier Monday 
in southern Iraq. Iraqi officials have given no estimate of military 
casualties but have said at least 425 civilians have been killed and 
thousands wounded. British officials say 8,000 Iraqis have been taken 
prisoner so far.

Allied warplanes and missiles blasted targets in Baghdad overnight, 
including Iraq's Olympic headquarters, where Saddam Hussein's son 
Odai is said to run a torture center. A steady series of explosions 
rumbled south of the capital Monday night and into Tuesday morning 
_ probably against Republican Guard positions _ after some of the 
strongest blasts in the capital since the war began March 20. Six 
explosions in rapid succession shook central Baghdad Monday night, 
sending smoke billowing from the Old Palace presidential compound 
and bathing the sky in a soft orange glow. Across the Tigris River, 
a target was hit in the city center less than a mile (a kilometer) 
from the Palestine Hotel, where many foreign journalists are staying. 
The 18-story hotel shook as if it had been struck by an earthquake. 
U.S. military officials said allied aircraft bombed a complex that 
serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee. Human 
rights activists have accused Saddam's son of jailing and torturing 
athletes there. The lower four floors of the nine-story Olympic building 
were severely damaged. Walls were blown out, and mangled wire and 
steel protruded. The building sits in a big complex of housing units, 
and they appeared unscathed. Early Tuesday, American forces launched 
missiles toward Baghdad and the city of Karbala to the southwest. 
A huge explosion rocked the Old Palace compound shortly after 9 a.m. 
On Monday night, Saddam and sons Odai and Qusai appeared on Iraqi 
television, with the station showing footage of a meeting of top military 
commanders. There was no way of determining when the video was shot. 
Saddam decorated commanders and troops of army units in Umm Qasr, 
the Faw peninsula and Nasiriyah for their ``heroic'' defense of the 
areas, state television said. A communique read on Iraqi satellite 
television said members of the 11th Division, which fought in Nasiriyah, 
would receive medals and their families would get 2 million dinars 
_ about US$670. Saddam was last shown on Iraqi television Saturday 
night. Odai had not been seen on Iraqi TV since the war began, according 
to Al-Arabiya television. The Americans had hoped to cut off television 
and radio transmissions to halt Iraqi propaganda, but repeated bombings 
have largely failed to silence the broadcasts. Iraqi television was 
off the air for about three hours Monday morning. But the local media 
operation was ``as good as it was before'' the attacks, Information 
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf declared. Nearly all of Baghdad's 
telephone lines appeared out in the city of 5 million after at least 
five telephone exchanges were bombed. But the city's power supply 
remains intact and street lights came on at night. Coalition bombardments 
have focused recently on Republican Guard units protecting the approaches 
to Baghdad. The goal is to wear down Saddam's best-trained forces 
ahead of a U.S.-led ground assault on the capital.

The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq will likely encourage North Korea to 
speed up its nuclear program, a top Russian diplomat warned Tuesday. 
''Unfortunately, the Iraqi situation is nudging North Korea toward 
the enhancement of its own defense capabilities,'' Deputy Foreign 
Minister Alexander Losyukov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news 
agency. ''North Korea earlier said that if it feels a threat, it would 
take appropriate steps, possibly including the creation of a certain 
powerful weapon for its own defense,'' he said. Asked whether the 
war in Iraq would encourage North Korea to continue developing its 
nuclear program, Losyukov was quoted as saying: ''That is absolutely 
obvious.'' ''I am afraid that the Iraqi situation is pushing (North 
Korea) in a direction that isn't in the interests of stability and 
security,'' Losyukov said. The North Korean nuclear crisis flared 
in October, when U.S. officials said North Korea acknowledged having 
a nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington and 
its allies suspended fuel shipments, and the North retaliated by expelling 
U.N. nuclear monitors, withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and restarting a nuclear reactor. Russia has urged Washington 
to immediately start talks with North Korea, warning that it is the 
only way to peacefully settle the crisis. (mb/ji)

A moderate earthquake shook northwestern Turkey on Tuesday forcing 
residents to flee their homes in a panic, the Istanbul-based Kandilli 
Observatory said. No injuries or damages were reported. The observatory 
said the quake, centered in the town of Akyazi, struck at 10:51 a.m.(0751 
GMT). A municipality official in Akyazi said teams had been dispatched 
to investigate any damage or injuries, but none had been reported. 
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said residents ran 
into the streets when the quake struck. Quakes are frequent in Turkey, 
which lies on the active North Anatolian fault. Two massive earthquakes 
hit northwestern Turkey in 1999, killing some 18,000 people. Akyazi 
is 150 kilometers (90 miles) west of Istanbul. ^ mn-ht

Backtracking from remarks by a Japanese military official, Japan's 
top government spokesman said his nation was still trying to confirm 
that North Korea test-fired a short-range missile Tuesday. The military 
officials said earlier in the day that North Korea test-fired a missile 
from its northwest coast into the Yellow Sea. Officials at the U.S. 
Defense Department in Washington later confirmed the launch. The Japanese 
and U.S. officials both said the missile did not represent a threat. 
However, South Korean officials _ who initially called the reported 
launch ``routine'' _ later cast the first doubt on the announcement, 
saying there was no evidence the launch had occurred. It was not immediately 
clear why there were conflicting reports. ``We have information about 
the missile but we have no confirmation,'' Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Yasuo Fukuda told reporters. ``We are still trying to confirm it.'' 
Japanese officials refused to disclose where they received the information, 
saying it was a security matter. Earlier Tuesday, the Japanese military 
and government officials _ including Koichi Furusho, chief of staff 
of the Maritime Self-Defense Forces, Japan's navy _ said North Korea 
fired a missile into the Yellow Sea. Japan last Friday launched two 
spy satellites into orbit to keep watch over the North's missile and 
nuclear programs, angering Pyongyang, which threatened to test-fire 
a missile. Fears have been growing that thre reclusive communist state 
might take advantage of the war in Iraq to escalate its missile and 
nuclear development. South Korean officials also flip-flopped after 
initially calling the launch ``routine.'' Its Defense Ministry later 
said there was no evidence that North Korea had test-fired a missile. 
``South Korean and U.S. military intelligence officials have checked 
on the report and concluded that there was no missile launch by North 
Korea,'' a ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity. 
South Korea's new government, headed by President Roh Moo-hyun, has 
made strong efforts to reduce tensions with North Korea. The U.S. 
military announced Tuesday that U.S. stealth fighter jets and other 
aircraft and troops currently in South Korea for joint war games will 
remain after the exercises are finished to act as a deterrent against 
North Korea. In 1998, North Korea fired a long-range missile that 
flew over Japan and plunged into the Pacific Ocean. It is believed 
to possess missiles that could reach parts of the United States. North 
Korea test-fired two short-range missiles in late February and early 
March amid tensions over its suspected nuclear weapons programs. Washington 
and South Korea have criticized the tests as attempts to force the 
United States into direct talks. With the United States focused on 
the war in Iraq, some experts say North Korea might exploit the opportunity 
to test long-range missiles or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make 
atomic bombs. The Korean nuclear crisis flared last October, when 
U.S. officials said North Korea admitted having a nuclear program 
in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington and its allies suspended 
fuel shipments, and the North retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, 
withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting 
a nuclear reactor.

The Boston Bruins qualified for the NHL playoffs Monday when Steve 
Shields made a key save in overtime to preserve a 2-2 tie with the 
Tampa Bay Lightning. Dan Boyle took a shot from point-blank range 
with 25 seconds remaining, but Shields stopped it with his pads. Coupled 
with the New York Rangers' overtime loss, the Bruins clinched an Eastern 
Conference playoff berth. The Lightning wrapped up no worse than the 
sixth seed in the East. ``It's all good to make the playoffs,'' Boston's 
Brian Rolston said, ``but you are here for one reason, to win the 
Stanley Cup.'' Tampa Bay's John Grahame held off the Bruins despite 
the Lightning being outshot 19-4 in the third period and overtime 
Tampa Bay extended its franchise-record unbeaten streak to 6-0-6 and 
is 13-2-8 in its last 23 games. But its long winless string in Boston 
continued. The Lightning are 0-14-4 there since their last victory 
_ Dec. 17, 1997. Overall, they're 1-15-5 in Boston. Mike Knuble and 
Nick Boynton scored for Boston. Ruslan Fedotenko and Fredrik Modin 
had goals for Tampa Bay. &lt; ^ Thrashers 4, Rangers 3, OT = In New 
York, Yannick Tremblay scored a power-play goal at 2:40 of overtime 
to give Atlanta a win over New York. Marc Savard had a pair of goals 
and added an assist for Atlanta, while Dany Heatley assisted on three 
goals _ including the game-winner. Eric Lindros was off for high-sticking 
when Tremblay scored. The Rangers trail the idle New York Islanders 
by three points with three games to play in the race for the final 
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The teams play Tuesday night 
on Long Island, and an Islanders victory would eliminate the Rangers 
from playoff contention. Mark Messier, Petr Nedved and Boris Mironov 
scored for the Rangers. Vyachaslev Kozlov had the other Atlanta goal. 
``I thought it was a great effort,'' Rangers coach Glen Sather said. 
``They busted their rear ends _ every one of them. We played hard. 
It was a good hockey game. It's too bad we couldn't win. We had six 
chances in the third period where the puck was bouncing all over the 
place and it just wouldn't go in.'' &lt; ^ Flyers 6, Penguins 1 = 
In Pittsburgh, Keith Primeau scored once and set up two goals in just 
over eight minutes of the second period as Philadelphia beat Pittsburgh 
for the fourth time in 17 days. The Penguins' Jamie Pushor scored 
the opening goal in the first period, but Flyers goaltender Roman 
Cechmanek had little difficulty thereafter. The Penguins are winless 
in 10 games at home (0-9-1), one short of the club record. They are 
1-16-2 overall in their last 19. John LeClair, Michal Handzus, Sami 
Kapanen, Radovan Somik and Marty Murray also scored for the Flyers, 
who moved within two points of idle New Jersey for the Atlantic Division 
lead. &lt; ^ Red Wings 3, Predators 0 = In Detroit, Curtis Joseph 
earned his 41st career shutout, and Sergei Fedorov had a goal and 
an assist as Detroit beat Washington to win its third straight Central 
Division title. Joseph stopped 27 shots for his fifth shutout of the 
season. Steve Yzerman and Henrik Zetterberg also scored for the Red 
Wings, who have 106 points. It was only the second goal for Yzerman 
since his return in late February from offseason knee surgery. &lt; 
^ Canadiens 4, Hurricanes 0 = In Raleigh, North Carolina, backup goaltender 
Mathieu Garon got his second shutout in seven games, stopping 33 shots 
as Montreal beat Carolina to snap a three-game losing streak. Saku 
Koivu, Francis Bouillon and Richard Zednik scored first-period goals 
for the Canadiens. Donald Audette closed out the scoring in the second 
period. &lt; ^ Wild 3, Flames 0 = In St. Paul, Minnesota, Manny Fernandez 
earned his eighth career shutout with 26 saves as Minnesota blanked 
Calgary. Cliff Ronning, Pierre-Marc Bouchard and Antti Laaksonen scored 
for Minnesota, which had three power-play goals for the first time 
this season. Fernandez, who notched his second shutout of the season, 
and Dwayne Roloson have a combined six. &lt; ^ Stars 3, Sabres 0 = 
In Dallas, Marty Turco made 18 saves for his sixth shutout of the 
season as the Dallas beat Buffalo to move into a tie for the NHL's 
best record. The Pacific Division-champion Stars have 107 points, 
one more than Detroit in the race for home ice throughout the Western 
Conference playoffs. Dallas pulled even with Eastern Conference leader 
Ottawa in the race for the NHL's top record. Dallas, 5-0-0-2 in its 
last seven games, got goals from Richard Matvichuk, Brenden Morrow 
and Rob DiMaio. &lt; ^ Blues 5, Oilers 5 = In St. Louis, Ethan Moreau 
scored Edmonton's third goal of the third period with 1:52 remaining 
in regulation as the Oilers rallied for a tie with St. Louis. It was 
the second big comeback in two days for the Oilers, who came back 
from a 4-1 deficit on Sunday to tie Chicago 4-4. The Blues had already 
lost out on a chance to win the Central Division when Detroit beat 
Nashville earlier Monday to clinch the title. Pavol Demitra and Scott 
Mellanby each had a goal and two assists for the Blues, who were 25-2-1-3 
when leading after two periods. In overtime, each team had two shots. 
St. Louis' Chris Osgood has given up 11 goals in his last two games. 
^ Avalanche 3, Sharks 1 = In Denver, Milan Hejduk had two goals and 
an assist, and Patrick Roy stopped 22 shots as Colorado beat San Jose 
to extended its home unbeaten streak to a team-record 16 games. The 
Avalanche trailed Vancouver by 13 points on Jan. 16, but have gone 
13-0-2-1 at home since then to pull within two games of Vancouver 
in the Northwest Division. Colorado reached 100 points for the fourth 
time in eight years in Denver and eclipsed the 40-win mark for the 
eighth consecutive year. Colorado's Peter Forsberg had three assists 
to eclipse the 100-point mark for the second time in his career. Roy 
became the first NHL goalie to eclipse 60,000 minutes. &lt; ^ Kings 
5, Coyotes 4, OT = In Phoenix, Steve Kelly scored 1:42 into overtime 
as Los Angeles snapped a seven-game winless streak with a win over 
Phoenix. The Coyotes rallied from a two-goal deficit in the third 
period to force overtime, but were victimized by loose goaltending 
for a third straight game. Phoenix has been outscored 16-6 in that 
span. Ziggy Palffy scored twice, while Kelly, Eric Belanger and Ian 
Laperriere had a goal and an assist each for the Kings, who were 0-4-2-1 
since beating Washington on March 14. Mike Johnson had two goals for 
the Coyotes. Paul Mara and Paul Ranheim had the others, and Jan Hrdina 
had two assists in his first game for Phoenix. But rookie Cristobal 
Huet of Los Angeles made 29 saves to remain unbeaten in three starts 
(2-0-1) and send the Coyotes to their season-high sixth straight loss.

Poland's health minister criticized the prime minister for appointing 
a top health care administrator against his wish and hinted in an 
interview with Polish state radio that he would quit his post in protest. 
``Holding a public function makes sense when you can fully implement 
the program and when you have support,'' Marek Balicki told Radio 
1. He scheduled a news conference later Tuesday morning, where the 
announcement was expected. The resignation would be the latest blow 
to Prime Minister Leszek Miller's troubled Cabinet. Two opposition 
parties on Friday said they will seek a parliamentary confidence vote 
aimed at unseating Interior Minister Krzysztof Janik for the recent 
botched police attempt to arrest two armed criminals that left two 
police officers dead Treasury Minister Slawomir Cytrycki also was 
at the center of controversy as a dispute flared over long-delayed 
plans to privatize a state-controlled insurance company. And Infrastructure 
Minister Marek Pol survived two confidence motions last week accusing 
him of incompetence and drafting a highway tax bill that had led to 
the coalition breakup. Health care reform has hamstrung a series of 
governments in post-communist Poland, where the medical care system 
is inefficient and hospitals are in debt. Balicki was appointed in 
January to replace Mariusz Lapinski, who was fired by Miller over 
his handling of the health care system's debts. Miller's appointment 
Monday of Aleksander Nauman to head a new national fund to administer 
the state health care system was criticized by Balicki, who said he 
doubted that the appointee would fully support reforms during a ``very 
difficult situation of health care and individual hospitals.'' Nauman 
is a holdover from the previous minister. The government says the 
new national health care fund, which began operation Tuesday, is the 
centerpiece of the an effort to make the chronically strapped health 
care system more efficient by centralizing medical payments. Based 
in the capital Warsaw, it replaces 17 regional funds that were set 
up by the previous Solidarity-led government to negotiate health care 
costs with local hospitals and doctors in an effort to introduce competition 
and market-oriented rules into the system. The government argues that 
the centralized system will make contract negotiations with hospitals 
and doctors easier. ^ (ms-tc-cb) &lt;

Continuing its Mediterranean cruise through Euro 2004 qualifying, 
France has docked in the Sicilian capital for an encounter with Israel 
on Wednesday. The match is considered a home game for the Israelis, 
who are not permitted to play in their own country due to UEFA worries 
about security in the Middle East. While security will be high for 
the match, the game itself should be another easy victory for the 
defending champions, the French. On Saturday, France routed Malta 
6-0 in Lens, improving slightly on the 4-0 win scored at the home 
stadium of the tiny island nation. In a slightly tougher test, France 
defeated Cyprus 2-1 in the eastern Mediterranean city of Nicosia in 
September. In all, ``Les Bleus'' have managed four wins in four qualifiers 
thus far, earning 12 points and thus running away with the automatic 
berth they can secure by winning the group. Israel and Cyprus, tied 
for second with four points each, are in a fight for second place 
and a spot in the playoffs. ``A zero-risk situation doesn't exist, 
but at the moment we don't feel under any particular threat,'' said 
team general manager Gerard Enault. France's current status is a far 
cry from its sorry state after scoring no goals and earning no points 
in last year's defense of its 1998 World Cup title. Since that ragged 
performance in South Korea, France's only losses have come in friendly 
matches. Yet coach Jacques Santini, who took control of the team following 
the World Cup, insisted his side is wary of Israel. ``I said that 
we couldn't take the Maltese lightly and the same goes for the Israelis,'' 
Santini said. ``There are no easy games or opponents, and for proof, 
just look at the results from the last round of qualifying. Who would 
have said that Germany would draw with Lithuania? ``I'm certain that 
the Israelis will find extra motivation by the fact that they can't 
count on the support of their fans.'' Santini could have also mentioned 
a 3-2 victory that Israel scored against France in qualifying for 
the 1994 World Cup, which helped keep France out of the U.S.-based 
tournament. For Wednesday's match, Real Madrid star Zinedine Zidane 
will once again wear the captain's armband for France, since Marcel 
Desailly is out with an injury. Zidane scored twice against Malta, 
breaking his yearlong scoring drought with the national team. Patrick 
Vieira, the man Zidane beat out for the armband honor, is expected 
to return from a knee injury that kept him out of the Malta contest. 
``It's not painful anymore and I'm at the coach's disposal,'' the 
Arsenal captain said. Israel is coming off a 1-1 draw at Cyprus, where 
Omri Afek scored on a header in just the second minute. On Wednesday, 
an early goal may be the Israelis only shot at staying competitive. 
Some 1,000 security officers will be deployed. About 500 Israeli fans, 
2,000 French fans and a couple thousand Italians were expected to 
turn out for the match. Said local organizer Alessandro Amato: ``I 
think the local fans have been scared off by all the security.'' Sagit 
Levy, who works for the Israeli soccer federation, said the situation 
here was not that much different from at home. ``We have a really 
tough situation in Israel,'' she said. ``There is a lot of security, 
but we try not to think about it.'' France reportedly did not want 
to play the match at one point because of safety fears. Zidane said 
his team had no trouble with the match logistics: ``We had to travel 
anyway. I would say, that if there is a problem, it's more for them 
because they can't play at home.'' (asd-fd)

In trying to agree on how to spend the billions of dollars President 
George W. Bush promised for a global fight against AIDS, the U.S. 
Congress can't get past the basic questions like whether it's more 
important to advise people to abstain from sex or to give them condoms. 
The House International Relations Committee, set to vote Wednesday 
on a five-year, $15 billion AIDS package that should win support from 
both parties, is at odds with the White House on where the money should 
go. The Senate was still searching for a consensus approach, and AIDS 
funding advocates were not optimistic for success. In his State of 
the Union address to Congress in January, Bush asked for $15 billion 
over five years, including $10 billion in new money, to fight AIDS, 
particularly the epidemic in Africa. ``Seldom has history offered 
a greater opportunity to do so much for so many,'' he said. White 
House differences with Congress, however, have resulted in postponed 
votes in both the House International Relations Committee and its 
Senate counterpart in recent weeks. The House, led by committee chairman 
Henry Hyde, is seeking $3 billion a year and would funnel up to $1 
billion of that in the 2004 budget year to the Swiss-based, Global 
Fund to Combat AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, administered by the 
United Nations. The White House has questioned the efficiency of the 
fund, even though it recently picked Health and Human Services Secretary 
Tommy Thompson as its chairman, and wants to give it only $200 million 
a year. The Global Fund gives money to the U.N. Population Fund, mistrusted 
by conservative groups because it supports groups that carry out or 
advise women about abortion. Hyde, a leader of anti-abortion lawmakers, 
has avoided that controversy so far by not including language, appearing 
in other foreign aid bills, that restricts aid to health and family 
planning groups that promote abortion. Conservative groups are not 
happy with that and also are intent on changing language in the bill 
dealing with condoms. The bill endorses the ``ABC'' approach that 
has had some success in Uganda, which stresses abstinence, being faithful 
and, when appropriate, condoms. But Connie Mackey of the Family Research 
Council said it doesn't go far enough toward making abstinence a priority 
over condom distribution. The Uganda experience, Mackey said, is proof 
of what works. ``We're hoping the bill will better reflect that,'' 
she said. Negotiators reportedly are considering language to make 
sure religious organizations that promote abstinence and oppose condom 
distribution will be eligible for AIDS funding. The House bill also 
ensures closer monitoring of the Global Fund and recommends that 55 
percent of the money go to treatment, 15 percent to hospice care and 
20 percent to prevention, with the rest for other purposes. In the 
Senate, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar also has tried 
to find a consensus that would satisfy the White House, the conservatives 
and the Democrats. ``It's going to take a little longer,'' Lugar's 
spokesman, Andy Fisher, said. ``The worst possible outcome is to see 
it descend into partisan rancor,'' said Mark Isaac, vice president 
of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. ``It's a matter 
of such urgency that it is crucial the parties come together.'' ``The 
idea of a bipartisan bill seems to be losing ground on the Senate 
side,'' warned Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance. 
The war in Iraq has distracted attention, he said, and the window 
of opportunity for moving the bill through Congress may be closing. 
Even without a bill, Congress can still respond to the president's 
request for more global AIDS money later in the year when it passes 
spending bills for the coming budget year. That path, advocates said, 
would leave Congress without the blueprint it needs on the best way 
to deal with the epidemic. ^ _ _ _ = On the Net: Global Aids Alliance:

The Los Angeles Lakers are running out of time to improve their playoff 
position. Shaquille O'Neal thinks that's no big deal. ``We want to 
move up in the standings. (But) it doesn't matter to us,'' O'Neal 
said after leading the three-time defending NBA champions to a 110-94 
victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night. ``If we don't 
move up, I'm not going to drink a can of rat poison.'' O'Neal had 
34 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots as the Lakers (43-31) 
won for the eighth time in 11 games. The Lakers are in seventh place 
in the Western Conference with eight games remaining, but could get 
as high as fourth. They trail Utah by a half-game, Minnesota by 2{ 
and Portland by three. ``Eight games,'' O'Neal said firmly when asked 
how far away the Lakers were from being playoff-ready. ``I think the 
guys are going to start focusing more. We know what it takes.'' The 
Lakers began the season by losing 19 of their first 30 games. They've 
gone 32-12 since then. Kobe Bryant had 29 points, five rebounds, eight 
assists and six steals to equal a career high as the Lakers bounced 
back from an ugly 119-98 loss at Seattle a night earlier. O'Neal shot 
15-of-22, making him 117-of-188 (62 percent) in the last nine games. 
Bryant was 10-of-23 including 3-of-5 from 3-point range. He's 20-of-33 
(61 percent) on 3-pointers in the last five games. ``We know what 
we're capable of doing and we know what our track record in the playoffs 
is,'' Bryant said. ``So we want to utilize our experience as much 
as possible, build as much rhythm and momentum as we possibly can 
going into the playoffs, and then use our experience to try to wear 
down teams. The Lakers put Memphis away by scoring six straight points 
for an 85-70 lead with 9:04 remaining. The Grizzlies weren't closer 
than 10 points after that. Pau Gasol led Memphis with 22 points and 
12 rebounds. Wesley Person added 20 points and Lorenzen Wright had 
14 points and 15 rebounds for the Grizzlies (26-48), who lost their 
fourth straight game. Mike Miller, who's averaging 16.1 points, was 
limited to nine minutes by back spasms.

The smallpox vaccine may be reborn _ as a cancer treatment. Scientists 
are rigging up the vaccine to carry an extra load, genes that signal 
the immune system to start fighting advanced tumors. Why use such 
a risky vaccine to do that job? The same super-reactive characteristics 
that make smallpox inoculation prone to some bad, occasionally deadly, 
side effects are, as the altered shots' creator puts it, ``an immunologist's 
dream:'' They may rev up an immune system that too often misses cancer. 
Although still in very early stages of research, the smallpox-turned-cancer 
shots look promising. They're the latest in a long quest to create 
immune-harnessing vaccines to attack cancer. ``We're not there yet,'' 
cautions Jeffrey Schlom of the National Cancer Institute, a specialist 
on cancer-treating vaccines who created the smallpox vaccine-based 
approach. ``But we're getting there.'' Despite the name, most so-called 
cancer vaccines don't aim to prevent tumors. These are not classic 
inoculations like the flu shot or even regular smallpox vaccine, which 
teach the body to recognize and subdue an invading virus or germ, 
preventing illness. The immune system doesn't always recognize cancer 
as something to attack, because tumors are made up of your own cells 
gone bad, not foreign germs. The hope with therapeutic cancer vaccines 
is to train powerful immune-system T cells to more easily spot and 
attack malignant cells. More than a dozen Phase 3 studies _ the most 
advanced testing _ of first-generation vaccines are under way. Most 
involve making patients custom shots using their own tumor cells mixed 
with immunity-boosting chemicals. Researchers frequently see a handful 
of people whose cancer dramatically shrinks, even disappears, for 
at least a while. But those amazing responses are rare, because cancer 
adapts, says NCI's Dr. Steven Rosenberg. So scientists are trying 
to develop more elaborate, hopefully better, vaccines. Enter smallpox 
vaccine. Schlom thought it could prove a good cancer-fighting platform 
because it's made with live vaccinia virus, a smallpox relative that's 
so large that adding different genes into it is fairly easy. Also, 
it's highly reactive, quickly causing a distinctive, infectious pustule 
that clearly signals a stimulated immune system. Schlom took a vaccinia 
version engineered to be milder than today's smallpox vaccine, which 
can occasionally cause deadly side effects. He added to it a gene 
that makes an antigen, or marker, called CEA that's found on many 
colon, pancreatic, lung and breast cancer cells. Because people become 
immune to vaccinia quickly, he created booster shots made with a less 
reactive vaccinia relative called fowlpox. And he added three immune-boosting 
molecules to the mix, calling it Tricom. Injecting the altered smallpox 
vaccine plus boosters every few months significantly increased survival 
of half the patients in the first, small experiment at Georgetown 
University. One patient saw her lung cancer disappear, and others 
who were expected to die within the year instead lived two years and 
counting. Jeannette DuBose Williams of Alexandra, Virginia, is one 
of them. After three surgeries, radiation and chemotherapy, she had 
run out of options to battle advanced colon cancer that had spread 
into her pelvis. Today, after 2{ years of Tricom shots, her cancer 
is still there _ but it hasn't grown, and she feels healthy, spending 
her days golfing and visiting grandchildren. ``Cancer may be one thing 
you're not going to cure, but maybe you can keep it in check,'' says 
Williams, 72. ``I don't know what this live virus is doing inside 
of me but ... I'm very grateful.'' Small experiments at the Dana-Farber 
Cancer Institute and Columbia University also proved promising. Now 
Schlom hopes to begin Phase 3 studies in another year. So far, none 
of the 400 cancer patients who have received some version of a smallpox-based 
shot have suffered serious side effects. That's possibly due to the 
milder vaccinia, and possibly because too few people have been vaccinated 
to count rare problems _ but studies are moving slowly as researchers 
carefully watch for side effects. It's way too early to know if pox-based 
cancer vaccines will prove truly helpful. Specialists won't even speculate 
on how soon more advanced testing of older, first-generation cancer 
vaccines might prove which ones are really useful _ the field is littered 
with setbacks. But ``we see the hope,'' says American Cancer Society 
vaccine specialist T.J. Koerner. _ _ _ EDITOR'S NOTE _ Lauran Neergaard

Allied warplanes and missiles blasted targets in Baghdad overnight, 
including one of Saddam Hussein's palaces and Iraq's Olympic headquarters. 
A steady series of explosions rumbled south of the capital Monday 
night and into Tuesday morning _ probably against Republican Guard 
positions _ after some of the strongest blasts in the capital since 
the war began March 20. Six explosions in rapid succession shook central 
Baghdad on Monday night, sending smoke billowing from the Old Palace 
presidential compound and bathing the sky in a soft orange glow. Across 
the Tigris River, a target was hit in the city center less than a 
mile from the Palestine Hotel, where many foreign journalists are 
staying. The 18-story hotel shook as if it had been struck by an earthquake. 
U.S. military officials said allied aircraft bombed a complex that 
serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where 
Saddam's son Odai is said to run a torture center. Human rights activists 
have accused him of jailing and brutalizing athletes who failed to 
please him. The lower four floors of the nine-story Olympic building 
were severely damaged. Walls were blown out, and mangled wire and 
steel protruded. The building sits in a big complex of housing units, 
and they appeared unscathed. Early Tuesday, American forces launched 
missiles toward Baghdad and the city of Karbala to the southwest. 
A huge explosion rocked the Old Palace compound shortly after 9 a.m. 
On Monday night, Saddam and sons Odai and Qusai appeared on Iraqi 
television, with the station showing video footage of a meeting of 
top military commanders. There was no way of determining when the 
video was shot. Saddam decorated commanders and troops of army units 
in Umm Qasr, the Faw peninsula and Nasiriyah for their ``heroic'' 
defense of the areas, state television said. A communique read on 
Iraqi satellite television said members of the 11th Division, which 
fought in Nasiriyah, would receive medals and their families would 
get 2 million dinars _ about $670. Saddam was last shown on Iraqi 
television on Saturday night. Odai had not been seen on Iraqi TV since 
the war began, according to Al-Arabiya television. The Americans had 
hoped to cut off television and radio transmissions to halt Iraqi 
propaganda, but repeated bombings have largely failed to silence the 
broadcasts. Iraqi television was off the air for about three hours 
Monday morning. But the local media operation was ``as good as it 
was before'' the attacks, Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf 
declared. Nearly all the telephone lines appeared out in the capital 
city of 5 million after at least five telephone exchanges were bombed. 
But the city's power supply remained intact and street lights came 
on at night. Coalition bombardments have focused recently on Republican 
Guard units protecting the approaches to Baghdad. The goal is to wear 
down Saddam's best-trained forces ahead of a U.S.-led ground assault 
on the capital.

Ratcheting up the war of words with Washington, Syria on Tuesday called 
the U.S.-British invasion of Iraq a ``fiasco'' and suggested American 
officials be tried for crimes against humanity. The English-language 
Syria Times newspaper _ one of several state-run newspapers _ said 
in an editorial that the invasion had proven to be a ``major embarrassment'' 
for the U.S. military and has led to anti-U.S. sentiments reaching 
``unprecedented levels.'' ``The only way out is to stop the war immediately 
and hold those responsible for it 'accountable' for their crimes against 
humanity,'' the newspaper said. In a speech Sunday, U.S. Secretary 
of State Colin Powell said ``Syria now faces a critical choice'' of 
whether to continue supporting terrorism ``in the dying days'' of 
Saddam Hussein's regime, suggesting it would face grave consequences. 
A Syrian Foreign Ministry official responded Monday by saying Syria 
``has chosen to stand by the Iraqi people who are facing an illegitimate 
and unjustified invasion.'' Commenting on Powell's warning, the Syria 
Times said Powell had a choice of his own to make: ``He can continue 
direct support for the military in the invasion of Iraq, or he can 
embark on a different and more hopeful course and quit. ... ``U.S. 
officials must accept full responsibility for the aggression fiasco,'' 
it said. ``The war is unjustifiable and illegal.'' Another Syrian 
newspaper, the Baath daily, said Syria ``does not need (U.S.) advice. 
``Syria is standing by itself and its nation by rejecting another 
aggression in the region,'' it said. ^ (zk-pfg) &lt;

Irish Nobel Peace Prize laureate John Humes arrived in Sri Lanka Tuesday 
to share his peacemaking experiences with Sri Lankan leaders and Tamil 
Tiger rebels. The Sri Lankan government has said it hopes to draw 
from Northern Ireland's experiences in creating a power-sharing administration 
in Sri Lanka's efforts to end a 19-year civil war that has killed 
nearly 65,000 people. Humes, former leader of the Social Democratic 
and Labor Party, Northern Ireland's moderate Catholic party, was a 
key player in formulating Ireland's Good Friday peace agreement in 
1998. He shared the Nobel Peace Prize the same year with David Trimble, 
leader of Northern Ireland's largest Protestant party, for their efforts 
to forge the power-sharing pact. A Norwegian-brokered cease-fire has 
stopped the fighting between the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tiger 
rebels and given the island nation its best chance for peace in recent 
years. The parties have held six rounds of peace talks, with the rebels 
saying they are willing to give up their demand for a separate state 
and accept a power sharing arrangement instead. Humes is to meet with 
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday, and then travel 
to northern rebel-held territory on Thursday to meet with Tamil Tiger 
leaders. He also is scheduled to give a lecture, meet with lawmakers 
and hold talks with President Chandrika Kumaratunga before leaving 
Sri Lanka on Saturday. The Tigers accuse the majority Sinhalese, who 
are predominantly Buddhist, of discrimination in education and jobs 
against the country's 3.2 million minority Tamils, most of whom are 
Hindu and live in the north.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus has received an order for seven 
A330-200 aircraft from Egyptair, the company announced Tuesday. Deliveries 
are scheduled to begin in June 2004, Airbus said. Egyptair plans to 
operate the new aircraft, which seat about 275 passengers, on routes 
mainly within the Middle East and to Europe. Based on Airbus catalog 
prices, the total order is worth about US$966 million, or US$138 million 
per plane. Egyptair is one of Airbus' main customers in the Middle 
East, and already operates seven A320s, four A321s, three A340-200, 
two A300B4 freighters and seven A330-600 aircraft. It already has 
five A320 planes on order, to be delivered in the coming months. (dj-eg)

A moderate earthquake shook northwestern Turkey on Tuesday forcing 
residents to flee their homes in a panic, the Istanbul-based Kandilli 
Observatory said. No injuries or damages were reported. The observatory 
said the quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 3.7, struck the town 
of Akyazi at 10:51 a.m. (0751 GMT). A municipality official in Akyazi 
said there were no reports of injuries or damage. Quakes are frequent 
in Turkey, which lies on the active North Anatolian fault. Two massive 
earthquakes hit northwestern Turkey in 1999, killing some 18,000 people. 
Akyazi is 150 kilometers (90 miles) west of Istanbul. ^ mn-ht-fd &lt;

The killing of seven women and children by U.S. troops in southern 
Iraq was a tragedy but doesn't compare with the deliberate killing 
of civilians by Iraqi forces, a British minister said Tuesday. ``This 
is a tragedy that's happened as a result of the heat of war, as opposed 
to the callous murder and slaughter of the Iraqi people by Saddam 
Hussein,'' Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram told Sky News television. 
U.S. soldiers shot and killed the civilians when the driver of their 
van failed to stop at a checkpoint as ordered, U.S. Central Command 
said. An American journalist who was at the scene said 10 Iraqis were 
killed on Monday, including five young children. The checkpoint near 
Najaf was about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the site of Saturday's 
suicide car bombing, in which an Iraqi soldier in civilian dress killed 
four U.S. soldiers. A British military spokesman acknowledged that 
Monday's shooting could undermine efforts to win the support of Iraqi 
civilians for the coalition campaign. ``If you were a civilian watching 
that, of course you would interpret it in that way,'' Col. Chris Vernon 
told British Broadcasting Corp. radio. But he said military commanders 
would back their troops in such incidents if they found the soldiers 
had acted against a perceived threat. ``We must allow our junior commanders 
who are doing the business on the ground to make the split decisions 
as they think best,'' Vernon said. ``If the decision is made that 
the threat against our soldiers is sufficient that they have to use 
self defense, then they will be fully supported.'' Ingram said Iraqis 
hostile to coalition troops as a result of the civilian deaths would 
likely change their attitude after a U.S.-led victory. ``Let's see 
what the mood of the Iraqi people is once we have removed Saddam Hussein 
and his evil regime,'' Ingram said. ``Just remember those pictures 
of a few days ago when the civilians were leaving Basra and the Republican 
Guards and the paramilitary groups loyal to Saddam Hussein were bombing 
and shooting their own people in many hundreds.'' British military 
officials and witnesses last Friday reported that Iraqi forces fired 
mortars and machine guns at around 1,000 Iraqi civilians trying to 
flee the southern city of Basra, which British troops have surrounded 
for more than a week. Many of the civilians were forced to retreat. 
One woman was reported badly injured by shrapnel, but there were no 
reports of civilian deaths in the incident. Britain has 45,000 personnel, 
including 26,000 soldiers, involved in the U.S.-led war on Iraq. Britain's 
Ministry of Defense said a soldier was killed Monday in southern Iraq 
while disposing of explosive ordnance, bringing the British death 
toll to 26 since the start of the war. The ministry said the soldier's 
family had been informed, but gave no further information. (ej-mm-rb)

The resignation was the latest blow to Prime Minister Leszek Miller's 
troubled minority government. Balicki said he objected to Miller's 
appointment of Monday of Aleksander Nauman to head a new national 
fund to administer the state health care system. In a radio interview 
earlier Tuesday, Balicki said he doubted that the appointee would 
fully support reforms during a ``very difficult situation of health 
care and individual hospitals.'' Nauman is a holdover from the previous 
minister. ^ MORE &lt;

The World Economic Forum said Tuesday it has postponed until fall 
a Beijing meeting of business and government leaders because participants 
were concerned about a deadly new flu-like disease. ``There's been 
a lot of concerns voiced by our participants about international and 
regional travel,'' said Pamela Mar, associate director for China at 
the Geneva-based organization. Mar said the Forum reached its decision 
after ``prudent'' consultations with the World Health Organization 
and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control about the spread of the disease, 
severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. ``We don't want our participants 
to feel they're having to jeopardize their safety to attend,'' Mar 
said. The meeting had been set for April 14-15. ``It's especially 
because so many of our participants are coming from within China and 
as well Hong Kong and Singapore, which have been very heavily hit,'' 
she said. ``People are just not feeling that comfortable about getting 
on airplanes.'' More than 1,600 people are believed infected with 
SARS worldwide, and more than 60 have died. Chinese officials last 
week acknowledged at least 34 deaths from the illness _ 31 of them 
in the southern province of Guangdong, where the disease is believed 
to have originated. ``It's difficult for us in good faith to have 
a summit where there's any chance or any risk or people feeling that 
it's dangerous to be there,'' Mar said. The meeting was intended to 
be the first major opportunity for the world business community to 
get to know the new leaders of China following changes by the National 
People's Congress. Also attending are to be top officials of the World 
Trade Organization, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development and 
other international bodies, as well as from selected countries, Mar 
said. A new date, tentatively expected in September or October, will 
be set following consultations with the participants, Mar said. The 
World Intellectual Property Organization, the U.N. agency to protect 
copyrights and patents, said Tuesday it was considering whether to 
postpone an April 24-26 meeting in Beijing. The meeting, billed as 
a ``summit'' with national leaders from different countries, expected 
to attend, is to discuss ``intellectual property and the knowledge 
economy.'' ``We are talking to the Chinese and assessing the situation,'' 
said spokeswoman Samar Shamoon, adding that the agency would probably 
make an announcement later this week. The International Labor Organization 
also is considering whether to go ahead with its China Employment 
Forum, due to take place in Beijing April 7-9. ^ (nk-agh-jf) &lt;

``I was firmly against the candidacy of Aleksander Nauman,'' Balicki 
said. ``I presented my opinion to the prime minister several times.'' 
Balicki's decision was the latest blow to Miller's Cabinet. Two opposition 
parties said Friday they will seek a parliamentary confidence vote 
aimed at unseating Interior Minister Krzysztof Janik for the recent 
botched police attempt to arrest two armed criminals that left two 
police officers dead Treasury Minister Slawomir Cytrycki also was 
at the center of controversy as a dispute flared over long-delayed 
plans to privatize a state-controlled insurance company. And Infrastructure 
Minister Marek Pol survived two confidence motions last week accusing 
him of incompetence and drafting a highway tax bill. Health care reform 
has hamstrung a series of governments in post-communist Poland, where 
the medical care system is inefficient and hospitals are in debt. 
Balicki was appointed in January to replace Mariusz Lapinski, who 
was fired by Miller over his handling of the health care system's 
debts. The government says the new national health care fund, which 
began operation Tuesday, is the centerpiece of the an effort to make 
the chronically strapped health care system more efficient by centralizing 
medical payments. Based in the capital Warsaw, it replaces 17 regional 
funds that were set up by the previous Solidarity-led government to 
negotiate health care costs with local hospitals and doctors in an 
effort to introduce competition and market-oriented rules into the 
system. The government argues that the centralized system will make 
contract negotiations with hospitals and doctors easier. ^ (ms-tc-cb)

The State Department criticized Israeli and Palestinian authorities 
for widespread abuses in their conflict, and denounced China for what 
it said was a long list of rights violations. In its annual human 
rights report released Monday, the State Department said many supporters 
of the U.S.-led war effort in Iraq had subpar rights records in 2002. 
Uzbekistan earned a ``very poor'' rating although the study acknowledged 
some notable improvements. In Eritrea, the report said, ``the government's 
poor human rights record worsened, and it continued to commit serious 
abuses.'' Qatar and Kuwait, also supporters of the war, were said 
to be generally respectful of their citizens _ as were Germany and 
France, two countries most identified with opposing the war. Introducing 
the report during a brief meeting with reporters, Secretary of State 
Colin Powell said the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq is liberating that 
country from a ``ruthless tyranny that has shown utter contempt for 
human life.'' He vowed to help the Iraqi people create a ``representative 
democracy that respects the rights of all of its citizens.'' The report, 
covering almost 200 countries, said respect for human rights was generally 
good in Latin America but it listed six countries where rights conditions 
were listed as ``poor'' _ Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, 
El Salvador and Venezuela. On Israel, the report said the country's 
overall human rights record in the occupied territories remained poor, 
and worsened in several areas as it continued to commit ``numerous, 
serious human rights abuses.'' ``Security forces killed at least 990 
Palestinians and two foreign nationals and injured 4,382 Palestinians 
and other persons during the year, including innocent bystanders,'' 
the report said. It said Israeli security forces targeted and killed 
at least 37 Palestinian terror suspects. ``Israeli forces undertook 
some of these targeted killings in crowded areas when civilian casualties 
were likely, killing 25 bystanders, including 13 children,'' the report 
said. It noted that the Israeli government said that it made every 
effort to reduce civilian casualties during these operations. The 
report also criticized the Palestinian Authority's rights record. 
It said many members of Palestinian security services and the Fatah 
faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization participated with 
civilians and terrorist groups in violent attacks against Israeli 
settlers, other civilians and soldiers. ``The PLO and PA have not 
complied with most of their commitments, notably those relating to 
the renunciation of violence and terrorism, taking responsibility 
for all PLO elements and disciplining violators,'' it said. Although 
there was no conclusive evidence that the most senior PLO or PA leaders 
gave prior approval for these acts, the report said some leaders endorsed 
such acts in principle in speeches and interviews. On China, the report 
said abuses included ``instances of extrajudicial killings, torture 
and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest 
and detention, lengthy incommunicado detention and denial of due process.'' 
At the same time, the report credited the government with some positive 
steps, including the release of a number of prominent dissidents and 
the granting of permission for senior representatives of the Dalai 
Lama to visit the country. The administration normally attempts to 
censure China on human rights grounds at the annual meeting of the 
U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The meeting is now in its 
third week, and Powell declined on Monday to say whether Washington 
will introduce a China resolution at the commission meeting. The report 
noted religious harassment in Russia, but praised President Vladimir 
Putin's government for installing a new criminal code that, for the 
first time, established that people could be arrested or detained 
only through judicial decision. ``The changes appeared to be having 
an effect on police, prosecutorial behavior and the judicial system, 
although there were reports of noncompliance in some regions,'' the 
report said. In Pakistan, a key ally in the war on terrorism, the 
report said the government's rights record remained poor. ``In general 
police continued to commit serious abuses with impunity,'' it said.

Struggling to contain the worldwide spread of the deadly flu-like 
illness that has killed at least 62 people, worried Asian governments 
Tuesday ordered tougher infection screening of air travelers and imposed 
other emergency measures. Badly hit Hong Kong said it could open rural 
camps to quarantine people who might have been exposed. Authorities 
in China urged physicians treating cases of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, or SARS, to disinfect everything they touch and wear 12-layer 
surgical masks. Thailand's government invoked an emergency regulation 
to give health officials the authority to quarantine arriving travelers 
suspected of having the illness for up to 14 days. Scientists have 
yet to identify the disease that has sickened more than 1,600 on three 
continents and they are working hard to find a cure. Its initial symptoms 
include fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Most victims have 
been in Asia. Hong Kong doctors say some have responded well to antibodies 
from others who recovered from the disease. Nurses were posted at 
Singapore's airport and identified seven suspected cases within their 
first 20 hours of duty. They were screening about 35 flights a day 
from Vietnam, Hong Kong, China and Ontario province in Canada - all 
hit by the disease. ``If we suspect a case or think a person is not 
feeling well we give them a mask and take them to hospital,'' said 
Albert Tjoeng, spokesman at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. 
Australia on Tuesday announced its first case _ a man who been in 
Singapore. He had recovered and the illness has not spread, health 
authorities said. Taiwan banned boats from sailing between an outlying 
island chain and mainland China, where the disease was first detected 
in November. Four recreational activity camps in rural Hong Kong areas 
could be turned into quarantine centers if the Health Department decides 
it's necessary, said Gordon Tam, a spokesman for the Leisure and Cultural 
Services Department. Meanwhile, hundreds of people remained confined 
inside a badly hit Hong Kong apartment building. Health officials 
on Monday sealed off the building in the 19-tower apartment complex, 
Amoy Gardens. Authorities said 213 residents of the entire complex 
remained hospitalized, though by Tuesday, just 185 had shown SARS 
symptoms. More than 600 people have been infected In Hong Kong and 
15 have died. In Canada, where a health emergency has been declared 
in Ontario province, Toronto authorities reported that at least two 
children had been hospitalized with the disease, and three others 
had symptoms. Taiwan temporarily banned shipping traffic between the 
Chinese mainland and the Matsu Islands, 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) off 
China's southern coast _ because the islands' clinics wouldn't be 
able to cope with a major outbreak, the government said Monday. Taiwan's 
known SARS cases remained at 13 Tuesday, while authorities issued 
more than 800 quarantine orders to people who had come into contact 
with patients. The Olympic Council of Asia decided to shift the site 
of its April 22-23 meeting from Vietnam, where four people have died 
from SARS, to Thailand, an official of the Thai National Olympic Council 
said. The World Economic Forum postponed a meeting of internation 
buisness and government leaders that had been scheduled for April 
14-15 in Beijing. The World Health Organization said Monday that experts 
hope to pinpoint the cause soon, and signs continue to point to the 
coronavirus, which causes about one-fifth of all colds. In a new and 
perplexing twist, the germ inside the Hong Kong apartment building 
seemed to be spreading vertically, a WHO official said. ``They are 
finding that the infections are in people living in apartments on 
top of each other, only in one area of this apartment block,'' virologist 
Klaus Stohr said at WHO headquarters in Geneva. That differs from 
the pattern seen earlier at the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong, where 
the disease spread when people who spent time on the ninth floor in 
late February were infected by a sick mainland Chinese medical professor. 
``That was horizontal, and now you have a vertical connection,'' Stohr 
said. ``You can talk about water pipes and sewage pipes, about drafts 
which move up and down _ that's pure speculation. These are hypotheses 
that are being looked into.'' Before the quarantine was imposed, many 
residents of the apartment building had fled in fear as dozens of 
people became sick, raising the possibility that SARS could spread 
further. The other 18 buildings in the complex were not sealed off 
despite having multiple SARS cases, but Hong Hong's health secretary, 
Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, said no other buildings were hit as badly. ``If 
isolation is effective to control the spread of the disease, we can 
say that this decision came too late,'' said Leung Ping-chung, an 
orthopedic and traumatology professor who has been monitoring the 
Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, where dozens of staff have 
been sickened. ``And who can say for sure who should be isolated?'' 
Leung said.

France's prime minister told lawmakers Tuesday that displays of anti-Americanism 
in protests against the war in Iraq would be ``unacceptable.'' The 
government should also be on guard against any signs of racism, anti-Semitism 
or xenophobia in the demonstrations, Raffarin was quoted as saying 
by spokesman Jean-Francois Cope. France has made a string of comments 
in recent days to attempt to smooth relations with the United States, 
which have been tense for months over Paris' high-profile opposition 
to military action in Iraq. Raffarin on Monday said that despite that 
opposition, France is not an enemy of the United States. Last week, 
the Foreign Ministry issued a special statement saying Paris hoped 
U.S.-led forces would win the war. ``It is indispensable to be vigilant 
against all displays of anti-Americanism, which would be unacceptable,'' 
Cope quoted Raffarin as telling representatives of Parliament on Tuesday. 
The government is also worried about the frequent protests against 
the war becoming a forum for anti-Semitism. Angry demonstrators attacked 
two young French Jews at a recent demonstration, and a human rights

Germany's ambassador to Australia on Tuesday criticized as too lenient 
a three-year suspended sentence handed to a tour guide blamed for 
the death of a German tourist killed by a crocodile. The suspended 
sentence means tour guide Glenn Robless, 46, will not serve any prison 
time unless he commits another offense. ``I was a bit amazed by the 
sentence which this person has got,'' ambassador Klaus-Peter Klaiber 
said on a visit to the northern city of Darwin. ``I don't know all 
the details, but I believe that probably in a German court he would 
not have got away with a suspended sentence.'' Robless was sentenced 
last week after pleading guilty in a Darwin court to the charge of 
making a dangerous omission which caused the death of backpacker Isabel 
von Jordan. He had faced a maximum 10-year sentence. Von Jordan, 23, 
was killed by a 4.6-meter (15-foot) crocodile after Robless took her 
and other tourists for a nighttime swim in a water hole in the Kakadu 
national park in northern Australia despite signs warning of the presence 
of crocodiles. ``He is running free and yet he was gravely engaged 
in that accident. There were warnings all over the place and he was 
an experienced tourist guide who should have known (better),'' Klaiber 
said. ``I think if you are so seriously disregarding rules and regulations 
which cause the death of a person then I think a little harsher sentence 
would have been justified.'' Klaiber warned that coverage of the case 
in the German press could deter people from visiting northern Australia 
_ where crocodiles inhabit many rivers and lakes.

Police said Tuesday they were closing in on an underworld boss _ an 
ally of Slobodan Milosevic _ who is the prime suspect in the assassination 
of Serbia's prime minister. Police said in a statement that Milorad 
Lukovic, a former paramilitary commander and the leader of an underworld 
Belgrade clan, also is linked to other politically motivated killings 
during Milosevic's autocratic rule. Lukovic and his gang ``killed 
political opponents'' of the former Yugoslav president and his wife, 
Mirjana Markovic, and ``tortured and harassed their foes,'' the statement 
said. Police said they discovered a Yugoslav diplomatic and a fake 
Croatian passport issued in Lukovic's name. The discovery ``will speed 
up the arrest of that criminal,'' they said. Lukovic has been on the 
run since the March 12 sniper assassination of Prime Minister Zoran 
Djindjic in downtown Belgrade. A special police unit under Lukovic's 
command until 2001 was suspected of having carried out Djindjic's 
killing after slaying former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic in August 
2000. The police statement came a day after authorities sought an 
international arrest warrant for Markovic, alleging she was involved 
in Stambolic's killing. She denounced the warrant in a message from 
Russia as a political ploy. Police said the investigation of Djindjic's 
killing ``clearly points to a conspiracy led by war criminals and 
war profiteers ... all from the ranks of Milosevic's regime.'' As 
president, Milosevic allowed underworld figures to fight alongside 
notorious paramilitary units in the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Afterward, 
he gave them a free hand to join regular police forces, such as the 
special police unit linked to crime and drug trafficking rings, authorities 
said. Those ties continued even after the pro-democracy leadership 
took over in 2000. Djindjic engineered Milosevic's extradition to 
the Netherlands-based U.N. war crimes tribunal. Later, Djindjic spearheaded 
efforts to crack down on the underworld, which made him many enemies. 
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Zarko Korac said Monday the warrant 
to be issued for Markovic's arrest was part of an effort by authorities 
to find those who ordered the killing of Stambolic. Authorities said 
there were ``credible suspicions'' of her involvement. Markovic became 
known as the ``red witch'' for the influence she wielded over Milosevic 
and his leftist Socialist Party. Stambolic, Serbia's president for 
a year in the late 1980s, was preparing to challenge Milosevic in 
national elections when he disappeared on Aug. 25, 2000, just two 
months before Milosevic was ousted. Serbian police last week discovered 
Stambolic's body during a crackdown on the paramilitary and underworld 
network accused of Djindjic's assassination. Markovic reportedly left 
for Russia in late February to join her son, Marko Milosevic, who 
fled Serbia following Milosevic's ouster. (ds/rp)

Poland's health minister quit Monday after criticizing Prime Minister 
Leszek Miller for appointing a top health care administrator against 
his wish. ``In such a situation, I cannot take responsibility for 
the health care system,'' Marek Balicki told a news conference. ``When 
you cannot serve the people, you have to submit your resignation.'' 
The resignation was the latest blow to Miller, who has headed a minority 
government since dumping the farm-based Peasants Party last month 
and has seen his Cabinet splinter under political pressures ahead 
of a June referendum on European Union membership. Balicki said he 
objected to Miller's appointment Monday of Aleksander Nauman to head 
a new national fund to administer the state health care system. In 
a radio interview earlier Tuesday, Balicki said he doubted that the 
appointee would fully support reforms during a ``very difficult situation 
of health care and individual hospitals.'' Nauman is a holdover from 
the previous minister. ``I was firmly against the candidacy of Aleksander 
Nauman,'' Balicki said. ``I presented my opinion to the prime minister 
several times.'' Balicki said Miller had accepted his resignation. 
Miller was proposing to replace him with Ewa Kralkowska, a deputy 
under the previous health minister. In other recent trouble for Miller, 
two opposition parties said Friday they will seek a parliamentary 
confidence vote aimed at unseating Interior Minister Krzysztof Janik 
for the recent botched police attempt to arrest two armed criminals 
that left two police officers dead. Treasury Minister Slawomir Cytrycki 
also was at the center of controversy as a dispute flared over long-delayed 
plans to privatize a state-controlled insurance company. And Infrastructure 
Minister Marek Pol survived two confidence motions last week accusing 
him of incompetence and drafting a highway tax bill. Health care reform 
has hamstrung a series of governments in post-communist Poland, where 
the medical care system is inefficient and hospitals are in debt. 
Balicki was appointed in January to replace Mariusz Lapinski, who 
was fired by Miller over his handling of the health care system's 
debts. The government says the new national health care fund, which 
began operation Tuesday, is the centerpiece of the an effort to make 
the chronically strapped health care system more efficient by centralizing 
medical payments. Based in the capital Warsaw, it replaces 17 regional 
funds that were set up by the previous Solidarity-led government to 
negotiate health care costs with local hospitals and doctors in an 
effort to introduce competition and market-oriented rules into the 
system. The government argues that the centralized system will make 
contract negotiations with hospitals and doctors easier. ^ (ms-tc-cb)

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. stealth fighter jets in South Korea 
for joint war games will remain to act as a deterrent against North 
Korea, the U.S. military said Tuesday amid conflicting reports about 
whether the communist state test-fired a short-range missile. Reports 
of the missile test came just days after Tokyo launched its first 
spy satellites into orbit to watch over the North's missile and suspected 
nuclear weapons programs. Japan and South Korea are concerned that 
Pyongyang might use the Iraq war to escalate the North's weapons development. 
Keeping the radar-evading U.S. aircraft in South Korea could further 
spike tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The F-117 stealth aircraft 
are capable of taking out the North's Yongbyon nuclear plant _ an 
attack North Korea has accused Washington of plotting. ``Extending 
their training time in the Korean Theater of Operations affords an 
excellent opportunity to further enhance interoperability while also 
enhancing deterrence,'' the U.S. statement said. Japanese officials 
initially said Tuesday that North Korea fired a ground-to-ship missile 
into the Yellow Sea, and U.S. officials confirmed the launch. Both 
said the launch was not a threat. But South Korean officials _ while 
initially describing the launch as ``routine'' _ later said there 
was no evidence it occurred. Japan subsequently announced it could 
not confirm the launch. There was no immediate explanation for the 
conflicting accounts. The U.S. military statement said that in addition 
to an unspecified number of stealth aircraft, some F-15E fighter jets 
and a small Army task force would stay on in South Korea. Thousands 
of troops have been here for the past months for war games withthe 
South's military that were scheduled to finish Wednesday. The statment 
said that more than 85 percent of those visiting forces would leave 
by Friday. About 37,000 U.S. troops are regularly based in South Korea 
as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. The last time the United States 
based stealth fighters in South Korea indefinitely was in 1994 when 
Washington was embroiled in a similar dispute with North Korea about 
its nuclear program. That crisis ended peacefully, but not before 
then-U.S.President Bill Clinton considered a surgical strike on Yongbyon. 
Ten years later, President George W. Bush has said he wants to peacefully 
resolve the crisis but has not ruled out a military solution. The 
current dispute flared in October when U.S. officials said North Korea 
admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994 deal. 
Pyongyang denies making such an admission. A spokesman for South Korea's 
Unification Ministry said keeping the stealth aircraft in the South 
would send a message to Pyongyang that it must not threaten its neighbors 
while U.S. forces are focused in Iraq. Pyongyang has repeatedly accused 
the United States of planning to invade the communist country after 
its forces are done fighting in Iraq. It has also said Washington 
was using the war games with South Korea as training for the attack. 
South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun has been trying to defuse tension 
with North Korea since taking office in February and has urged Washington 
to hold direct talks with Pyongyang. U.S. officials have refused to 
hold bilateral meetings with North Korea, favoring multilateral talks 
that would include North Korea's neighbors. Japanese military officials 
said Tuesday that North Korea had fired a missile with a range of 
about 60 kilometers (40 miles), from the northwestern coast of the 
peninsula. But Japan later backtracked. ``We have information about 
the missile but we have no confirmation,'' Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Yasuo Fukuda told reporters. ``We are still trying to confirm it.'' 
In 1998, North Korea fired a long-range missile that flew over Japan 
and plunged into the Pacific Ocean. It is believed to possess missiles 
that could reach parts of the United States. North Korea test-fired 
two short-range missiles in late February and early March. Washington 
and South Korea have criticized the tests as attempts to force the 
United States into direct talks.

Another cow in northern Italy has tested positive for mad cow disease, 
bringing the country's total to 92, the Health Ministry said Tuesday. 
The animal came from a farm in the province of Turin, a health official 
said, citing confirmation from a Turin zoological institute that acts 
as the nation's national control center for the disease. Italy detected 
its first case of the disease, a chronic degenerative disorder affecting 
the central nervous system of cattle, in 2001. Tests began after the 
European Union ordered mandatory testing on cattle older than 30 months 
destined for slaughter. Last year, Italy reported its first case of 
the human form of the brain-wasting illness in a young woman in Sicily. 
Experts believe the human variant of the illness is transmitted by 
eating meat from infected livestock. Almost 1.5 million animals have 
been examined since testing started, the ministry said. (ic/ar)

About 50 Pakistanis protested in Hong Kong Tuesday against new visa 
requirements that the territory's government said were imposed on 
Pakistan and other countries ``due to the war in Iraq.'' ``What do 
you mean, due to the war in Iraq?'' asked one demonstrator, Syed Qaisar, 
who owns an electronics business in Hong Kong. ``We are not from Iraq. 
We are not from America.'' Hong Kong immigration officials said Friday 
that citizens of Pakistan and Eritrea will require visas to enter 
the territory under new measures imposed because of the war. Both 
had previously been allowed to stay visa-free for up to 14 days. The 
demonstrators accused Hong Kong of unfairly singling them out. They 
chanted outside government headquarters with a sign that said: ``We 
are not terrorist Pakistanis.'' Qaisar noted that Pakistan enjoys 
good relations with China, which regained sovereignty over Hong Kong, 
a former British colony, in July 1997. The Immigration Department 
said in a statement that its new policy was ``due to the war in Iraq,'' 
but did not specify what connection Pakistan and Eritrea might have 
with that conflict. Asked about any connections, a spokeswoman for 
the department said Tuesday she had no immediate answer but would 
try to get one. Hong Kong's visa policies ``take into account factors 
such as the social, economic and political situations of countries,'' 
the Immigration statement said. Hong Kong also said Friday it had 
``increased its scrutiny'' of visa applications from Iraqis, Afghans, 
Iranians, Lebanese, Libyans, Palestinians, Sudanese and Syrians ``until 
further notice.''

A court in Azerbaijan sentenced 15 people on Tuesday to two to nine 
years in prison in connection with a village protest last year that 
turned violent. Police opened fire June 2 on demonstrators seeking 
better services in the village of Nardaran, about 25 kilometers (15 
miles) from Baku. One villager was killed, 15 others received gunshot 
wounds and 50 suffered other injuries. About 80 police officers were 
also injured. Villagers said they were just asking for gas for heating 
and cheaper drinking water, but Azeri authorities have accused the 
village of being a center of Islamic extremism. Alikram Aliyev, a 
senior member of the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, was sentenced to 
nine years in prison. Jabrail Alizade, a member of the village's council 
of elders, received an eight-year sentence. Two others received five-year 
sentences, and 11 villagers received sentences between two and three 
years. The villagers were convicted of organizing massive disorder, 
acting against the authorities and participating in and organizing 
activities that breach community order. Since the June protest, Nardaran 
has become a flashpoint of anti-government activity, hosting regular 
protests. Azerbaijan's opposition has accused President Geidar Aliev 
of stifling dissent and media freedom in this Caspian Sea nation. 
Aliev, a Communist Party boss in Soviet times, has twice won elections 
criticized as fraudulent. (as/mb/ji)

British Prime Minister Tony Blair has postponed his trip to China, 
a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday. ``As to the specifics, 
you 'll have to refer it to the British side, but it is certainly 
not because of SARS,'' said Liu Jianchao, referring to severe acute 
respiratory syndrome, which has killed at least 34 people in China. 
China welcomes Blair to visit at an appropriate time, said Liu at 
a regularly scheduled briefing. A spokesman for the British Embassy 
in Beijing declined to comment, citing a policy of never releasing 
details of Blair's schedule. The dates of Blair's planned visit had 
not been released. More than 1,600 people are believed infected with 
SARS worldwide, and 62 have died _ including at least 34 in China, 
the government has said. Organizers have canceled the women's world 
ice hockey championships, scheduled to begin in Beijing on Thursday. 
The Rolling Stones have also canceled concerts in Hong Kong, Shanghai 
and Beijing due to concerns over the illness. On Saturday, the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control recommended travelers put off nonessential 
trips to China.

Rock star Mark Knopfler has canceled his British tour following a 
motorbike accident in which he broke six ribs and a collar bone, his 
agent said Tuesday. Publicist Judy Shaw of Mercury Records said the 
Dire Straits front man has canceled eight shows, scheduled June 2-9, 
because of the injuries he sustained in the March 17 crash. ``Owing 
to injuries sustained in his recent motorbike accident, and acting 
on medical advice, Mark Knopfler has reluctantly been forced to cancel 
all shows on his proposed tour,'' Shaw said in a statement. ``Mark 
is obviously bitterly disappointed and would like to thank the fans 
who have sent him get well messages,'' she said, adding that ticket 
holders would be refunded. Knopfler was knocked from his Honda bike 
when it collided with a Fiat Punto in Belgravia, central London. The 
female driver of the Fiat was reported to be unhurt. A leading exponent 
of the moody rock lament and one of the world's most respected guitarists, 
Knopfler has penned a series of hit songs, including ``Love Over Gold,'' 
``Sultans of Swing,'' ``Romeo and Juliet'' and ``Brothers in Arms'' 
that have won Dire Straits an ardent international following. His 
most recent production was the solo album, ``The Ragpicker's Dream.'' 
In 1999, Knopfler was made an officer of the Order of the British 
Empire, or OBE. (ej-mm)

France's prime minister told lawmakers Tuesday that displays of anti-Americanism 
in protests against the war in Iraq would be ``unacceptable.'' The 
government should also be on guard against any signs of racism, anti-Semitism 
or xenophobia, Jean-Pierre Raffarin was quoted as saying by spokesman 
Jean-Francois Cope. France has made a string of comments in recent 
days to attempt to smooth relations with the United States, which 
have been tense for months over Paris' high-profile opposition to 
military action in Iraq. Raffarin on Monday said that despite that 
opposition, France is not an enemy of the United States. Last week, 
the Foreign Ministry issued a special statement saying Paris hoped 
U.S.-led forces would win the war. ``It is indispensable to be vigilant 
against all displays of anti-Americanism, which would be unacceptable,'' 
Cope quoted Raffarin as telling representatives of Parliament on Tuesday. 
The government is also worried about the frequent protests against 
the war becoming a forum for anti-Semitism. Angry demonstrators attacked 
two young French Jews at a recent demonstration, and a human rights 
group posted monitors along an anti-war march route to guard against 
displays of anti-Semitism. The government ``will not tolerate any 
racist, anti-Semitic or xenophobic acts,'' Cope quoted Raffarin as 
saying. (parf-jc)

Struggling to contain the worldwide spread of the deadly flu-like 
illness that has killed at least 62 people, worried Asian governments 
Tuesday ordered tougher infection screening of air travelers and imposed 
other emergency measures. Badly hit Hong Kong said it could open rural 
camps to quarantine people who might have been exposed. Authorities 
in China urged physicians treating cases of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, or SARS, to disinfect everything they touch and wear 12-layer 
surgical masks. China's Foreign Ministry said British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair had postponed a planned trip to Beijing, but denied it 
was due to SARS fears. Thailand's government invoked an emergency 
regulation to give health officials the authority to quarantine arriving 
travelers suspected of having the illness for up to 14 days. Scientists 
have yet to identify the disease that has sickened more than 1,600 
on three continents and they are working hard to find a cure. Its 
initial symptoms include fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. 
Most victims have been in Asia. Hong Kong doctors say some have responded 
well to antibodies from others who recovered from the disease. Nurses 
were posted at Singapore's airport and identified seven suspected 
cases within their first 20 hours of duty. They were screening about 
35 flights a day from Vietnam, Hong Kong, China and Ontario province 
in Canada - all hit by the disease. ``If we suspect a case or think 
a person is not feeling well we give them a mask and take them to 
hospital,'' said Albert Tjoeng, spokesman at the Civil Aviation Authority 
of Singapore. Australia on Tuesday announced its first case _ a man 
who been in Singapore. He had recovered and the illness has not spread, 
health authorities said. Taiwan banned boats from sailing between 
an outlying island chain and mainland China, where the disease was 
first detected in November. Four recreational activity camps in rural 
Hong Kong areas could be turned into quarantine centers if the Health 
Department decides it's necessary, said Gordon Tam, a spokesman for 
the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. Meanwhile, hundreds 
of people remained confined inside a badly hit Hong Kong apartment 
building. Health officials on Monday sealed off the building in the 
19-tower apartment complex, Amoy Gardens. Authorities said 213 residents 
of the entire complex remained hospitalized, though by Tuesday, just 
185 had shown SARS symptoms. More than 600 people have been infected 
In Hong Kong and 15 have died. In Canada, where a health emergency 
has been declared in Ontario province, Toronto authorities reported 
that at least two children had been hospitalized with the disease, 
and three others had symptoms. Taiwan temporarily banned shipping 
traffic between the Chinese mainland and the Matsu Islands, 5.6 miles 
(9 kilometers) off China's southern coast _ because the islands' clinics 
wouldn't be able to cope with a major outbreak, the government said 
Monday. Taiwan's known SARS cases remained at 13 Tuesday, while authorities 
issued more than 800 quarantine orders to people who had come into 
contact with patients. The Olympic Council of Asia decided to shift 
the site of its April 22-23 meeting from Vietnam, where four people 
have died from SARS, to Thailand, an official of the Thai National 
Olympic Council said. The World Economic Forum postponed a meeting 
of internation buisness and government leaders that had been scheduled 
for April 14-15 in Beijing. The World Health Organization said Monday 
that experts hope to pinpoint the cause soon, and signs continue to 
point to the coronavirus, which causes about one-fifth of all colds. 
In a new and perplexing twist, the germ inside the Hong Kong apartment 
building seemed to be spreading vertically, a WHO official said. ``They 
are finding that the infections are in people living in apartments 
on top of each other, only in one area of this apartment block,'' 
virologist Klaus Stohr said at WHO headquarters in Geneva. That differs 
from the pattern seen earlier at the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong, 
where the disease spread when people who spent time on the ninth floor 
in late February were infected by a sick mainland Chinese medical 
professor. ``That was horizontal, and now you have a vertical connection,'' 
Stohr said. ``You can talk about water pipes and sewage pipes, about 
drafts which move up and down _ that's pure speculation. These are 
hypotheses that are being looked into.'' Before the quarantine was 
imposed, many residents of the apartment building had fled in fear 
as dozens of people became sick, raising the possibility that SARS 
could spread further. The other 18 buildings in the complex were not 
sealed off despite having multiple SARS cases, but Hong Hong's health 
secretary, Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, said no other buildings were hit as 
badly. ``If isolation is effective to control the spread of the disease, 
we can say that this decision came too late,'' said Leung Ping-chung, 
an orthopedic and traumatology professor who has been monitoring the 
Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, where dozens of staff have 
been sickened. ``And who can say for sure who should be isolated?'' 
Leung said.

Six Israeli soldiers are spending their reserve duty guarding a lone 
settler living illegally in a trailer on a West Bank hill, costing 
the country an estimated US$43,000 a month, an Israeli legislator 
said Tuesday. Ran Cohen from the dovish Meretz party raised the issue 
with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on Monday, at a meeting of parliament's 
Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee. Sharon said he would look into 
the case, according to Cohen. Dozens of tiny outposts have been set 
up by settlers in recent years on West Bank hilltops to prevent the 
handover of land in a peace deal with the Palestinians. In most cases, 
just a few settlers live in the outposts, which are guarded by troops. 
The outpost cited by Cohen is near the Palestinian town of Jenin. 
Yehoshua Mor-Yosef, a spokesman for Jewish settlers, insisted that 
at least five settlers live there. ``Next week there will be more 
settlers than soldiers,'' he said. ``Now that it has been on the news, 
we'll make sure more settlers go there.'' Israel has come under increasing 
international pressure to remove the outposts, as a first step toward 
a settlement freeze. Sharon told the parliamentary committee Monday 
that the outposts would eventually be dismantled, but did not say 
when. Successive Israeli governments have moved more than 200,000 
settlers into 150 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since 
capturing the lands _ claimed by the Palestinians for a state _ in 
the 1967 Mideast war. The United States holds that the settlements 
are an obstacle to peace, and has urged Israel repeatedly to freeze 
construction, so far to no avail. Cohen said the Israeli government 
looks the other way when settlers establish outposts. Money is being 
wasted on guarding them, at a time when the government is trying to 
cut billions of dollars from the state budget as part of an austerity 
plan aimed at combating one of the worst recessions in the country's 
history, he said. ``We are not talking about the army securing residents. 
We are talking about a lone settler who is acting insubordinately 
and he is causing six reserve soldiers to endanger their lives,'' 
he added. Israeli media reported Monday that the six reserve soldiers 
offered to pool their money and pay for the settler's stay in a hotel 
in Israel so they wouldn't have to guard him anymore. The settler 
declined, the reports said. ^ rpm-kl &lt;

Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with prices edging higher 
in Tokyo but slipping in Hong Kong. Japan's 225-issue Nikkei Stock 
Average rose 14.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,986.72. On Monday, 
the index lost 307.45 points, or 3.71 percent. The Nikkei index eked 
out gains in a seesaw session marking the first day of Japan's fiscal 
year. Blue chips Honda Motor, Toyota Motor, TDK, Japan Telecom and 
NTT DoCoMo led the rebound, which traders attributed to bargain hunting 
following a dizzying drop Monday of almost 4 percent. Market sentiment 
remained subdued, however, as investors were discouraged by growing 
pessimism over the prospects for the war in Iraq. A central bank survey 
released Tuesday morning showed business sentiment among major Japanese 
manufacturers worsened in the January-March quarter as worries grew 
that falling stock prices and the war in Iraq may hurt economic recovery. 
In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 118.04 yen, down 0.98 
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below the 118.14 yen in late 
New York trading overnight. In Hong Kong, the key Hang Seng Index 
slipped 37.56 points, or 0.44 percent, to 8,596.89, its lowest close 
since October 1998. On Monday, the index had fallen 228.91 points, 
or 2.58 percent. Shares slumped early in the session on rumors _ later 
denied _ that the Hong Kong government would declare the territory 
an infected area because of the spread of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, or SARS, which has killed 15 people and sickened 610 others 
here. Prices recouped most of their losses late in the afternoon after 
the government denied the rumors. Elsewhere: SINGAPORE: Shares closed 
higher on bargain-hunting, with gains led by banks and blue chips. 
The Straits Times rose 14.76 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,282.58. 
TAIPEI: Taiwan shares closed slightly higher on bargain hunting. The 
Weighted Price Index rose 16.39 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,337.61. 
WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed slightly lower amid speculation 
that the war in Iraq will be prolonged. The NZSE-50 gross index fell 
6.84 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,924.77. MANILA: Philippine shares 
closed lower. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 
1.60 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,038.07. SYDNEY: Australian shares 
closed marginally lower. The All Ordinaries Index fell 4.40 points, 
or 0.15 percent, to 2,844.20. SEOUL: South Korean shares closed higher 
on bargain hunting, with investors shrugging off news that North Korea 
test-fired a short-range missile. The Korea Composite Stock Price 
Index rose 2.86 points, or 0.5 percent, to 538.56. KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian 
shares closed lower, pushed down by fears of a protracted war in Iraq 
and the impact of the deadly SARS disease that is spreading through 
the region. The Composite Index of 100 blue-chip stocks fell 8.61 
points, or 1.4 percent, to 627.11. JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed 
mixed. The Composite Index rose 0.05 points, or 0.01 percent, to 398.05. 
BANGKOK: Thai shares closed mixed. The Stock Exchange of Thailand 
Index fell 2.33 points, or 0.6 percent, to 362.22.

An additional 75 people were hit by a mystery flu-like disease in 
Hong Kong, including 52 from an apartment complex where one building 
has been placed under an isolation quarantine order, health officials 
said Tuesday. An 83-year-old man with severe acute respiratory syndrome, 
or SARS, has also died, bringing the territory's death count to 16, 
the Health Department said Tuesday evening. It was not immediately 
clear if he had died Monday or Tuesday. Most of the new SARS patients 
are people from the Amoy Gardens apartment complex, where more than 
240 residents were ordered Monday to spend 10 days inside one building 
that has been sealed off. Hong Kong has now reported 685 cases of 
SARS but says 84 people have recovered and been discharged from hospitals. 
The disease has sickened more than 1,600 and killed at least 62 globally. 
The Health Department says most of the SARS patients who died either 
had histories of chronic diseases or who had sought treatment relatively 
late.

Tokyo stocks posted marginal gains on bargain hunting Tuesday. The 
U.S. dollar was lower against the yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock 
Average rose 14.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to end trading at 7,986.72. 
On Monday, the index lost 307.45 points, or 3.71 percent. It lost 
27.7 percent of its value over fiscal 2002, which ended Monday. The 
dollar bought 118.04 yen at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), down 0.98 yen from 
late Monday in Tokyo and below the 118.14 yen it bought in late New 
York trading overnight. The currency traded from 117.78 yen and 118.44 
yen in Tokyo. On the stock market, the benchmark Nikkei index eked 
out gains in a seesaw session marking the first day of Japan's fiscal 
year. Blue chips Honda Motor, Toyota Motor, TDK, Japan Telecom and 
NTT DoCoMo led the rebound, which traders attributed to bargain hunting 
following a dizzying drop Monday of almost 4 percent. ``The market 
rebounded on adjustment as yesterday was overdone,'' said Masatsugu 
Okeya, general manager at Chuo Securities. Market sentiment remained 
subdued, however, as investors were discouraged by growing pessimism 
over the prospects for the war in Iraq. A central bank survey released 
Tuesday morning showed business sentiment among major Japanese manufacturers 
worsened in the January-March quarter as worries grew that falling 
stock prices and the war in Iraq may hurt economic recovery. Volume 
on the first section was estimated at 863.83 million shares, up from 
715.09 million shares Monday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 734 
to 611, with 161 issues unchanged. The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index 
closed up 0.96 points, or 0.12 percent, to 788.96. The TOPIX, which 
includes all first-section issues, closed down 29.92 points, or 3.66 
percent, Monday. In currencies, the dollar was under pressure amid 
continued worries over the U.S. economy and uncertainty about the 
war in Iraq. The euro bought US$1.0904 Tuesday late Tuesday in Tokyo, 
up from US$1.0874 late Monday. Against the yen, the euro traded at 
128.64 yen, down from 129.40 yen. The yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year 
government bond slipped to 0.6900 percent from 0.7000 percent late 
Monday. Its price rose 0.09 to 101.02. _ _ _ On the Net: Japan's Tokyo

About 2,000 protesters marched through Manila on Tuesday to protest 
the U.S.-led attack on Iraq, as the Philippine foreign secretary supported 
a call for Saddam Hussein to step down. About 20 motorcycle riders 
led the marchers _ chanting ``Stop the war in Iraq!'' _ down the Makati 
business district's main road. Shirtless men and boys with letters 
painted on their torsos formed a line with the message: ``War is stupid!'' 
One activist wore an Uncle Sam hat and carried a toy rifle as he pulled 
an effigy of Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, depicted 
as a lapdog with its tongue sticking out and painted with the American 
flag. Arroyo is among the staunchest Asian allies of the U.S.-led 
war on terrorism. She said the Philippines is part of the ``coalition 
of the willing,'' providing moral and political support to U.S. actions 
to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. Anti-war protests, 
most at the U.S. Embassy, have been held almost daily since the attack 
on Iraq began last month. Philippine Foreign Secretary Blas Ople said 
on Tuesday he supports the Saudi Arabian foreign minister's suggestion 
that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein should step down for the sake of 
his people. ``Perhaps with the greater good of his people in mind, 
and with more nations echoing the same sentiment, perhaps President 
Saddam might heed such a suggestion and end the war by leaving Iraq,'' 
Ople said in a statement. Saddam would ``spare the Iraqi people from 
further humanitarian suffering'' by stepping down, Ople said. Last 
month, Arab leaders declined to endorse a proposal from the United 
Arab Emirates for Saddam to step down and leave the country to avoid 
a U.S.-led invasion. The Iraqis later refused to accept an Arab League 
delegation after reports circulated that the members would raise the 
possibility of Saddam going into exile.

A Russian doctor said Tuesday that he has launched an effort to bring 
wounded children out of Iraq and urged the United States to cooperate 
with the initiative, which would require a temporary halt to attacks 
on Baghdad and Basra. Leonid Roshal, an emergency pediatrician who 
said he was involved in operations to evacuate civilians during the 
conflicts in the Balkans and Afghanistan, told a news conference that 
the children of Iraq are ``in a cauldron'' because of the war. ``When 
we thought about this, it was clear that help was needed,'' he said. 
Roshal, who is working alongside the Russian Red Cross on the evacuation 
effort, said the idea was his and did not come from the Kremlin, but 
that President Vladimir Putin has expressed support. Putin has sharply 
criticized the U.S.-led war, saying it could cause a humanitarian 
catastrophe. Roshal wants to conduct a broad evacuation campaign, 
but he said the first step would be to try to remove wounded children 
from Baghdad and Basra. They could be treated in Russia and other 
countries and return to Iraq after the war. Iraq's ambassador to Russia, 
Abbas Khalaf, made a blunt statement last week saying that Iraq does 
not need humanitarian aid, but Roshal said he later received Khalaf's 
support for the initiative. Roshal said he was told by the Iraqi embassy 
that there were 95 wounded children in hospitals, but he said the 
figure should be verified by international organizations. He said 
he met Friday with U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow who conveyed his 
request to Washington, but that he had not yet received an answer. 
``It would be a very big mistake if they refuse,'' Roshal said. A 
U.S. Embassy official confirmed Roshal had asked for U.S. assistance 
in getting to Baghdad and getting children out safely, and that the 
request was forwarded to Washington. The official said Roshal indicated 
the plan was to remove seriously injured children in need of sophisticated 
treatment. Roshal said the initiative would require a halt to hostilities 
in the cities involved. ``If America says, for instance, from 1800 
hours to 2400 hours we will not bomb,'' then children could be evacuated, 
he said. It was not yet clear what exit routes would be used under 
the plan, which Roshal said needs support from international organizations 
such as the International Committee of the Red Cross. ICRC representatives 
in Moscow were very cautious in an initial meeting, Roshal said, and 
he and Russian Red Cross director Tatyana Nikolayenko plan to fly 
Wednesday to Geneva for talks at the organization's headquarters. 
On Monday, they plan to meet with U.N. agencies in New York to discuss 
setting up an international committee on evacuating children. (sbg/mb)

THE OIL FIELDS: Firefighters resumed efforts Tuesday to extinguish 
the remaining two blazes at sabotaged oil wells in Iraq's Rumeila 
South oil field. A shortage of water on Monday hindered a team from 
Boots &amp; Coots International Well Control, while Kuwaiti firefighters 
were unable to contain a fire at a damaged well head nearby. Rumeila 
South, just north of the Kuwait-Iraq border, is one of Iraq's biggest 
oil fields. The number of oil well fires there has dwindled to two 
from seven. Firefighters still hope to put out the last two fires 
within a week. Some Iraqis who previously worked at Rumeila South 
were returning to ask for their jobs back and were being screened 
by the military, said Boots &amp; Coots president, Brian Krause. Once 
the last fires are beaten, U.S. firefighters plan to replace the field's 
damaged well heads. Then they expect to move on to other oil fields, 
including some near Basra, Iraq's No. 2 city, and the northern oil 
center of Kirkuk _ once allied troops secure those areas. Kirkuk is 
the nation's No. 2 oil-producing region after the Rumeila fields. 
THE MARKET: Crude oil futures fell early Tuesday, after a strong finish 
the previous day. On London's International Petroleum Exchange, North 
Sea Brent futures for May delivery lost 30 cents and were trading 
at US$26.88 a barrel by late morning. Brent futures closed 83 cents 
higher on Monday at US$27.18. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, 
the May contract for U.S. light, sweet crude dropped 69 cents to US$30.35 
a barrel in electronic, pre-session trading. U.S. crude futures closed 
Monday at US$31.04, up 88 cents. (bs-rb)

Chinese authorities are recommending that doctors isolate patients 
suspected of having severe acute respiratory syndrome, disinfect anything 
patients touch and wear face masks during treatment, according to 
guidelines available Tuesday on the top disease-control agency's Web 
site. The recommendations, issued by the Chinese Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention, came after days of criticism of the country's 
communist government for its sluggish approach to the new illness, 
known as SARS. ``Hospitals must attach great importance to isolation 
work and disinfection,'' the government's guidelines say. Beijing-based 
officials from the World Health Organization said they were given 
the guidelines late Monday, but an official at the center who gave 
his name only as Mr. Zhou said they were posted Friday. More than 
1,600 people are believed infected with SARS worldwide, and more than 
60 have died. Chinese officials last week acknowledged at least 34 
deaths from the illness _ 31 of them in the southern province of Guangdong, 
where the disease is believed to have originated. Chinese officials 
have released little public information about the malady and have 
yet to begin providing daily updates on the disease as promised to 
WHO investigators who arrived in Beijing over a week ago. A WHO spokesman 
said Tuesday that investigators were also still awaiting permission 
to visit Guangdong where they hope to find clues into the disease's 
origin and spread. ``The Chinese government has not covered up. There 
is no need,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said Tuesday. 
``We have nothing to hide.'' Barely an hour later, a CNN satellite 
feed to an apartment compound housing foreigners in Beijing went black 
during a report on the illness _ something that has happened in the 
past when the news network reports about the banned Falun Gong spiritual 
movement or other stories that make the communist government uneasy. 
The 17 pages of detailed guidelines posted on the disease agency's 
Web site instruct hospitals to transfer patients suspected of having 
SARS to designated hospitals that have specialists in infectious diseases, 
respiratory problems and intensive care. Medical staff who interact 
with such patients should wear masks with 12 layers of fabric and 
protective caps, gloves and goggles. Anything patients touch _ including 
blood-pressure cuffs and ambulance equipment _ should be disinfected, 
the guidelines say. Hospitals are also told to disinfect the air in 
hallways, rest rooms, X-ray departments and other public spaces twice 
a day using spray disinfectant and, in some areas, germ-killing ultraviolet 
light. Local authorities were also told to improve ``scientific publicity'' 
to encourage the public to get early diagnosis and treatment, wash 
hands often and avoid crowded public areas such as cinemas. State-controlled 
newspapers and broadcasts monitored in Beijing made no mention Tuesday 
of the sickness. The central government's Health Ministry and local 
health authorities in Beijing, Guangdong and the northern province 
of Shanxi, where four cases have been reported, would say nothing. 
At Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport, large numbers of travelers arriving 
from the Philippines, Hong Kong and South Korea wore surgical masks, 
but only a few of those flying in from Beijing did so _ a possible 
result of the lack of coverage in the state-controlled mainland press. 
Despite the silence, many Chinese have learned about the disease from 
foreign broadcasts and the Internet. Pharmacies in Beijing are selling 
out of surgical masks and report swift sales of herbal remedies often 
credited with preventing infection. On Tuesday, The World Economic 
Forum said it has postponed a Beijing meeting of business and government 
leaders because of concerns about SARS. The women's world ice hockey 
championships and two Rolling Stones concerts have also been canceled 
on the mainland. And on Saturday, the U.S. Centers of Diseases Control 
recommended travelers put off nonessential trips to China. Medical 
staff at seven Beijing-area hospitals visited on Tuesday were wearing 
face masks, though hospital officials all either denied seeing SARS 
cases or refused to talk. Beijing United Family, a joint-venture hospital 
that serves the expatriate community, said in a posted notice that 
the hospital was ``closely watching the situation.'' Hospital officials 
said they have seen no cases of SARS, either at the hospital or within 
the larger expatriate community. ``We will remain vigilant, taking 
all necessary precautions,'' Dr. Sarah Borwein, head of the hospital's 
committee for handling potential SARS cases, said in a written statement. 
Hospital officials said they had been in frequent contact with government 
health authorities but refused to discuss details.

Afghan government troops searching for rebels found a stash of weapons 
in an abandoned mountain camp believed to have been a base for Taliban 
fighters, a senior Afghan official said Tuesday. The troops, following 
a trail in the Dara-e-Noor mountains north of Kandahar, stumbled on 
tents and mud huts that appeared to be a base for about 30 Taliban 
fighters, said Khalid Pashtoon, a spokesman for the regional governor. 
``We found some explosive material they were using to make bombs,'' 
Pashtoon said. They also found motorcycles. Pashtoon said the Taliban 
had ordered the residents of two nearby villages, Thanaucha and Ilabac, 
to leave _ apparently in preparation for a battle with government 
forces _ Pashtoon said after returning from the area. The discovery 
was made in Shahmardan Ghar, 70 kilometers (45 miles) north of Kandahar. 
The area was the scene of recent fighting between Afghan government 
troops and suspected Taliban fighters in which eight Taliban were 
killed and 12 captured. One of the dead was identified as Mullah Gul 
Mahd, a front-line commander with the Taliban militia, Pashtoon said.

Northern Ireland's Nobel Peace Prize laureate John Hume arrived in 
Sri Lanka Tuesday to share his peacemaking experiences with Sri Lankan 
leaders and Tamil Tiger rebels. The Sri Lankan government has said 
it hopes to draw from Northern Ireland's experiences in creating a 
power-sharing administration in Sri Lanka's efforts to end a 19-year 
civil war that has killed nearly 65,000 people. Hume, former leader 
of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, Northern Ireland's moderate 
Catholic party, was a key player in formulating Northern Ireland's 
Good Friday peace agreement in 1998. He shared the Nobel Peace Prize 
the same year with David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's largest 
Protestant party, for their efforts to forge the power-sharing pact. 
A Norwegian-brokered cease-fire has stopped the fighting between the 
Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tiger rebels and given the island 
nation its best chance for peace in recent years. The parties have 
held six rounds of peace talks, with the rebels saying they are willing 
to give up their demand for a separate state and accept a power sharing 
arrangement instead. Hume is to meet with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe 
on Wednesday, and then travel to northern rebel-held territory on 
Thursday to meet with Tamil Tiger leaders. He also is scheduled to 
give a lecture, meet with lawmakers and hold talks with President 
Chandrika Kumaratunga before leaving Sri Lanka on Saturday. The Tigers 
accuse the majority Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist, of 
discrimination in education and jobs against the country's 3.2 million 
minority Tamils, most of whom are Hindu and live in the north. ^ (dss)

An additional 75 people were hit by a mystery flu-like disease in 
Hong Kong, including 52 from an apartment complex where one building

clear if he had died Monday or Tuesday. Most of the new SARS patients 
are people from the Amoy Gardens apartment complex, where more than 
240 residents were ordered Monday to spend 10 days inside one building 
that has been sealed off. Hong Kong has now reported 685 cases of 
SARS but says 84 people have recovered and been discharged from hospitals. 
The disease has sickened more than 1,600 and killed at least 63 globally. 
The Health Department says most of the SARS patients who died either 
had histories of chronic diseases or who had sought treatment relatively 
late.

Train engineers for the German railroad will vote Thursday in whether 
to accept an arbitrator's recommended wage package to end a dispute 
that has disrupted thousands of travelers, officials said Tuesday. 
Arbitrators recommended late Monday a settlement that would give the 
engineers a 3.2 percent raise next year. The proposed settlement echoes 
a deal reached March 15 with labor unions that represent other Deutsche 
Bahn employees. I'm optimistic it will gain approval,'' Deutsche Bahn 
spokesman Uwe Herz said. The deal will see workers receive two payments 
of 200 euros (US$216) each this year, followed by a 3.2 percent raise 
from May 1, 2004. It also will bring pay for employees in formerly 
communist eastern Germany up to parity with that of those in the more 
affluent west by 2006. Rail workers staged a series of short stoppages 
in early March, and striking engineers on March 6 briefly brought 
trains to a halt across the country. Later that day, the GdL union 
walked out of pay talks with Deutsche Bahn, taking the dispute to 
arbitration. GdL went into the pay talks seeking a 3-percent wage 
increase this year. The rail company, which is in the middle of an 
efficiency drive to make it fit for possible privatization, had warned 
that a big pay rise could force it to lay off more staff. (swg-cb)

Manchester United on Tuesday reported a 34 percent fall in profits 
but an overall improvement in its financial picture. Pre-tax profits 
in the six months ending Jan. 31 were reported at 20.3 million pounds 
(US$32.1 million), a decrease from the same period the previous year 
when the club sold Jaap Stam and Andy Cole for 16.3 million pounds 
(US$25.5 million). The world's richest soccer club said sales in the 
six-month period rose 13 percent to 92.6 million pounds (US$146.3 
million). Operating profits before player sales increased 32 percent 
to 31.1 million pounds (US$49.1 million). Manchester United said its 
salary bill for the the period was 39.7 million (US$52.7 million), 
43 percent of sales. It said that was within the target of 50 percent. 
The club said it expected its wage bill to reach 50 percent at the 
end of the next reporting period. Chief executive Peter Kenyon said 
Manchester United's financial health contrasted with the problems 
experienced by other English clubs. ``We have significantly improved 
our operating performance,'' Kenyon said. ``The strength of the balance 
sheet and our diversified revenue streams have increased the resilience 
and competitiveness of Manchester United plc.'' ``We're delighted 
with what we think are a strong set of financial results. Today our 
shareholders will be very happy that we have a business which sets 
ourselves apart from the rest of the industry.'' (scw)

Allied warplanes and missiles blasted targets in Baghdad overnight, 
including one of Saddam Hussein's palaces, Iraq's Olympic headquarters 
and an air force officers club. A steady series of explosions rumbled 
south of the capital Monday night and into Tuesday morning _ probably 
against Republican Guard positions _ after some of the strongest blasts 
in the capital since the war began March 20. Six explosions in rapid 
succession shook central Baghdad on Monday night, sending smoke billowing 
from the Old Palace presidential compound and bathing the sky in a 
soft orange glow. U.S. warplanes also dropped bombs on an Iraqi presidential 
yacht and another ship in the southern port of Basra, Navy officials 
said Tuesday. Planes from the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk flew 
53 strike missions Monday and into the early hours of Tuesday, dropping 
58 500-pound (225-kilogram) laser-guided bombs, six 1,000-pound (450-kilogram) 
laser-guided bombs and eight satellite-guided bombs. Across the Tigris 
River, a target was hit in the city center less than a mile from the 
Palestine Hotel, where many foreign journalists are staying. The 18-story 
hotel shook as if it had been struck by an earthquake. The target 
was believed to be a former Iraqi Air Force headquarters that was 
being used as a club for air force officers and their families, according 
to Iraqis familiar with the area. The building was reduced to a heap 
of gray rubble, a few pillars and an outside wall. A statue of Saddam 
just outside the building was intact. U.S. military officials said 
allied aircraft also bombed a complex that serves as the office of 
the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where Saddam's son Odai is said 
to run a torture center. Human rights activists have accused him of 
jailing and brutalizing athletes who failed to please him. The lower 
four floors of the nine-story Olympic building were severely damaged. 
Walls were blown out, and mangled wire and steel protruded. The building 
sits in a big complex of housing units, and they appeared unscathed. 
Early Tuesday, American forces launched missiles toward Baghdad and 
the city of Karbala to the southwest. A huge explosion rocked the 
Old Palace compound shortly after 9 a.m. On Monday night, Saddam and 
sons Odai and Qusai appeared on Iraqi television, with the station 
showing video footage of a meeting of top military commanders. There 
was no way of determining when the video was shot. A statement broadcast 
by Iraq TV also said Saddam's family members were in Iraq and had 
not fled. The statement accused the U.S. Department of Defense of 
starting false rumors. Saddam decorated commanders and troops of army 
units in Umm Qasr, the Faw peninsula and Nasiriyah for their ``heroic'' 
defense of the areas, state television said. A communique read on 
Iraqi satellite television said members of the 11th Division, which 
fought in Nasiriyah, would receive medals and their families would 
get 2 million dinars _ about $670. Saddam was last shown on Iraqi 
television on Saturday night. Odai had not been seen on Iraqi TV since 
the war began, according to Al-Arabiya television. The Americans had 
hoped to cut off television and radio transmissions to halt Iraqi 
propaganda, but repeated bombings have largely failed to silence the 
broadcasts. Iraqi television was off the air for about three hours 
Monday morning. But the local media operation was ``as good as it 
was before'' the attacks, Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf 
declared. Nearly all the telephone lines appeared out in the capital 
city of 5 million after at least five telephone exchanges were bombed. 
But the city's power supply remained intact and street lights came 
on at night. Coalition bombardments have focused recently on Republican 
Guard units protecting the approaches to Baghdad. The goal is to wear 
down Saddam's best-trained forces ahead of a U.S.-led ground assault 
on the capital.

The Spanish health ministry said Tuesday it was monitoring a probable 
case of the flu-like illness that has killed 62 people around the 
world. If confirmed it would be Spain's first case, after a false 
alarm last month in the southwest Extremadura region. Doctors in Bilbao 
in the Basque region were awaiting results of tests on a 31-year-old 
man who returned March 21 from a trip to Hong Kong and mainland China 
and fell ill a few days later. The patient was hospitalized Monday 
in Bilbao and placed in isolation, the Basque health department said. 
Scientists have yet to identify the disease, which has sickened more 
than 1,600 people, mostly in Asia, and they are working to find a 
cure. Its initial symptoms include fever, dry cough and shortness 
of breath. Since March 17 Spanish health authorities have monitored 
20 flights arriving from Asia and checked 2,633 travelers, the health 
ministry said. (dw)

Bennett King isn't certain he wants to become West Indies cricket 
coach and says the sport's national administrators had erred by announcing 
his appointment before completing contract negotiations with him. 
The West Indies board announced Monday that King, coach at the Australian 
Cricket Academy in Adelaide, had been appointed as Roger Harper's 
replacement in the West Indies job. King said the media had been informed 
of his pending appointment before he'd received a phone call from 
the Caribbean officials to confirm he was their preferred candidate. 
``They've nominated me as the preferred candidate and I haven't agreed 
to anything,'' King told the Australian Associated Press late Tuesday. 
``I've seen no terms or conditions.'' King said he was upset at the 
premature announcement. He applied for the job last December and had 
an interview last month. Asked if he would replace Harper, King replied: 
``I'll tell you when they get some terms on the table.'' The Australian 
test squad flew out Monday for a four-test series against the West 
Indies in the Caribbean. Former test batsman Gus Logie was appointed 
interim coach for the West Indies and it was expected that King would 
take over in July. ``I believe the first week in July they're looking 
at me being there, but in terms of making a decision, I can't do anything 
until they give me something,'' said King. ``We'll wait and see. I 
need a bit more time to think about it all.'' Harper quit after the 
West Indies were ousted in the first round of the World Cup. (jp)

Backtracking from remarks by a Japanese military official, Japan's 
top government spokesman said his nation was ``still trying to confirm'' 
that North Korea test-fired a short-range missile Tuesday. A Japanese 
admiral said Tuesday afternoon that North Korea test-fired a shore-to-ship 
missile from its northwest coast into the Yellow Sea. The U.S. Defense 
Department in Washington confirmed the report, and officials in both 
countries said the missile did not represent a threat. But Japan's 
top government spokesman backed away from those remarks hours later, 
speaking after South Korean officials said there was no evidence the 
launch had occurred. ``We have information about the missile but we 
have no confirmation,'' Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda 
said. ``We are still trying to confirm it.'' Fukuda told reporters 
the Japanese government had received reports that North Korea had 
launched a missile and had issued a warning for ships to avoid waters 
off its northwestern coast. The reclusive communist nation announced 
similar ``exclusion zones'' when it test-fired two short-range missiles 
in late February and early March, according to U.S. and Japanese officials. 
Japanese officials refused to disclose the source of the reports, 
saying it was a security matter. Tokyo and Washington are bound by 
a security treaty and regularly exchange intelligence. The reason 
for the conflicting reports was not clear. The confusion began when 
Koichi Furusho, chief of staff of Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Forces, 
told reporters North Korea had fired a missile into the Yellow Sea. 
South Korean initially echoed the report, calling the reported launch 
``routine.'' But its Defense Ministry later said there was no evidence 
that North Korea had test-fired a missile. ``South Korean and U.S. 
military intelligence officials have checked on the report and concluded 
that there was no missile launch by North Korea,'' a ministry official 
said on customary condition of anonymity. Pyongyang threatened to 
test-fire a missile after Japan launched two spy satellites Friday 
to keep watch over the North's missile and nuclear programs. Fears 
have been growing it might take advantage of the war in Iraq to escalate 
its missile and nuclear development. The U.S. military announced Tuesday 
that U.S. stealth fighter jets and other aircraft and troops currently 
in South Korea for joint war games will remain after the exercises 
are finished to act as a deterrent against North Korea. In 1998, North 
Korea fired a long-range missile that flew over Japan and plunged 
into the Pacific Ocean. It is believed to possess missiles that could 
reach parts of the United States. North Korea test-fired two short-range 
missiles in late February and early March amid tensions over its suspected 
nuclear weapons programs. Washington and South Korea have criticized 
the tests as attempts to force the United States into direct talks. 
With the United States focused on the war in Iraq, some experts say 
North Korea might exploit the opportunity to test long-range missiles 
or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make atomic bombs. The Korean nuclear 
crisis flared last October, when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted 
having a nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington 
and its allies suspended fuel shipments, and the North retaliated 
by expelling U.N. monitors, withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and restarting a nuclear reactor.

British forces reported Tuesday the first indications that the tide 
of the war in southern Iraq may be turning in their favor, saying 
troops were patrolling in berets, not helmets, in four towns. In addition 
to improved security, lights flickered on for the first time in months 
in the port city of Umm Qasr, schools and shops were reopening and 
civilians were increasingly informing foreign troops about the whereabouts 
of paramilitary forces and members of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's 
Baath Party, British officials said. ``Within the southern area of 
Iraq, we see a large degree of normality starting to appear amongst 
the Iraqi population,'' said Group Capt. Al Lockwood, a spokesman 
for British forces in the Gulf. He stressed that tensions were still 
high in Basra, Iraq's second-largest city where British forces have 
skirmished almost daily with forces loyal to Saddam while trying to 
provide humanitarian aid to the city's 1.3 million people. And operations 
continued in the region of British patrols, including a raid on Baath 
party members in the town of Safwan, said another British spokesman, 
Col. Chris Vernon. But Lockwood said residents were increasingly willing 
to approach British troops who have ringed the city to inform about 
known paramilitaries and other loyalists. ``They realize that we are 
there to liberate them, not to occupy,'' he said. ``Certainly, there 
are still military engagements happening with the paramilitary forces, 
but the aid is flowing into Basra now.'' A senior U.S. Central Command 
official said late Monday he sensed that Basra may be nearing the 
``tipping point,'' when civilians would turn on the regime and support 
the troops. He stressed though that was a feeling, not a hard assessment. 
``You'll get to the tipping point at different places and different 
times,'' the official said, speaking on condition he not be identified 
further. ``I sense we're near the tipping point in Basra. I sense 
we're near the tipping point in An Nasiriyah,'' another southern city 
where U.S. troops have faced stiffer-than-expected resistance but 
have recently reported some cooperation from locals in hunting down 
regime supporters. The official said he had also received reports 
that farther to the north, in Najaf, civilians were lashing out at 
regime figures. The British appear confident that they have reached 
some level of security in four southern towns. On Tuesday, British 
troops had changed their combat helmets for berets in Umm Qasr, As 
Zubayr, Rumeila and Safwan, British officials said. Lockwood said 
the development was significant for two reasons: It makes the soldiers 
appear more friendly and approachable, and serves as a confidence-building 
measure on both sides. ``It shows that we have confidence in them, 
and they can have confidence in us,'' he said. In addition, more humanitarian 
aid was flowing into the region, including from the United Nations 
and other aid organizations, he said. Vernon called As Zubayr the 
``litmus test,'' saying British troops had control of the town and 
were patrolling it, routing the last militia members and Baath party 
officials. U.S. and British officials have acknowledged the expected 
uprising by anti-Saddam Shiite residents of Basra and other southern 
towns in support of coalition troops hasn't borne out to any large 
degree. They have attributed the residents' wariness to the fact that 
when Shiites did rise up in 1991, allied forces largely abandoned 
them and left them to be punished by the Iraqi leadership. ``They 
have suffered tragically, enormously under the Saddam Hussein regime,'' 
Lockwood said. ``And although it's taken some time because of the 
events of 1991, they're beginning to gain the confidence now, they 
know we're not going away. They know we will be there to protect them.''

Italian police have arrested four people _ one Egyptian, one Somali 
and two Iraqi Kurds _ who are suspected of having links with Islamic 
terrorist groups, anti-terrorism police said Tuesday. The arrests 
were ordered by Milan prosecutor Stefano Dambruoso, who has been leading 
investigations into suspected Islamic cells in Italy. Bruno Megale 
of Milan's anti-terrorism police confirmed the arrests but refused 
to say where or when the arrests were made, saying the probe was in 
progress. The Italian news agency ANSA and other reports said that 
two were picked up in Milan and two in Parma, another northern Italian 
city. They were planning to leave the country, the reports said. Italian 
dailies Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica, reporting on the arrests 
that were apparently carried out Monday evening, said the men were 
suspected of belonging to an extremist Islamic group based in northern 
Iraq and called Ansar al-Islam. Corriere said that before the arrests, 
the suspects' telephone conversations had been tapped for months. 
Dambruoso's office said the prosecutor was in meetings and couldn't 
comment on the reports. U.S. officials believe that Ansar al-Islam, 
a tiny Kurdish group, is linked to al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden's terror 
network. In a speech before the U.N. Security Council in February, 
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said that bin Laden's man in 
Iraq, Abu Musab Zarqawi, has set up a camp in a corner of northern 
Iraq controlled by Ansar al-Islam. Powell also said that Zarqawi and 
his network have plotted terrorist actions against several countries, 
including Italy. The arrests were the latest in a series of raids 
that have brought dozens of suspected terrorists behind bars in Italy. 
Many of those suspects were later released for lack of evidence. (ar-fd)

Fearful that the isolation quarantine of 240 people in a Hong Kong 
building has not stopped the spread of a mystery disease, health officials 
said Tuesday they would move the residents into quarantine camps. 
Residents of Block E of the Amoy Gardens Apartment complex were being 
moved Tuesday night to the holiday camps, one in the suburban New 
Territories and one in a rural part of Hong Kong island, said Dr. 
Leung Pak-yin, deputy director of health. Leung said ``environmental 
factors'' in the sealed-off building might be causing the disease 
to spread, but he did not elaborate in an evening news conference. 
There has been speculation a sewage leak might have spread the disease 
among residents of apartment units at one end of the 33-story building.

CASTEAU, Belgium (AP) _ NATO's new military commander in Europe outlined 
his vision Tuesday of an alliance transformed to tackle 21st-century 
threats of terrorism and instability, even as its members remain bitterly 
divided over the Iraq war. U.S. Marine Gen. James L. Jones told reporters 
first elements of NATO's rapid reaction force should be operational 
this year. It would eventually be able to deploy thousands of troops 
to troublespots around the world _ if the alliance's political leaders 
can agree on it. ``We are seeing a military metamorphosis of the alliance,'' 
said Jones, who took up his NATO post Jan. 17. ``If the nations wish 
to have a force that has an out-of-area capability, beyond a regional 
capability, we could build that.'' Jones' comments came as NATO diplomats 
in Brussels embark on tentative discussions on a possible alliance 
role in peacekeeping in Afghanistan, or even postwar Iraq. Although 
divisions over Iraq have plunged NATO into a deep crisis, diplomats 
at alliance headquarters in the Belgian capital are sounding out support 
for a role in peacekeeping or nation-building after the fighting is 
over there. The United States last year proposed NATO take on such 
a role, but the plan was shelved in the face of opposition from France, 
Germany and Belgium. Diplomats say informal talks have resumed on 
the plan that would build on NATO's experience peacekeeping in Bosnia 
and Kosovo. NATO officials said it was far too early to see if a consensus 
could be found among the 19 allies. France and Belgium have already 
expressed doubts about a proposal for the alliance to take over command 
of the peacekeeping operation in the Afghan capital Kabul, which is 
currently being led by German troops. Diplomats from other countries 
were still hopeful a solution could be found that would give the alliance 
a greater role there. Jones stressed he had received no orders to 
prepare for NATO operations in either Afghanistan or Iraq, but he 
highlighted the debate within the alliance over a possible role, well 
beyond its traditional Euro-Atlantic theater. Speaking at alliance 
military headquarters in southern Belgium, he outlined plans for the 
proposed NATO reaction force of 20,000-strong rapidly deployable, 
air, land and sea units to be the spearhead of a leaner, more agile 
alliance. Addressing budget concerns of European members, Jones said 
the more mobile, lighter forces needed by NATO could be constructed 
without major new outlay. ``So much of the money that we need can 
be done through some in-depth reforms,'' he said. ``My goal is to 
build or the NATO reaction force from existing capacities without 
asking for more money.'' Jones, who also serves as commander of U.S. 
forces in Europe, restated plans to restructure the American deployment 
away from the Cold War focus on major concentrations in Germany, to 
smaller, more flexible bases in new NATO members to the east, such 
as Romania and Bulgaria, who are due to join next year. He repeated 
that such plans were based on the needs of military modernization, 
rather than U.S. displeasure at Germany's opposition to the Iraq war. 
Jones welcomed European Union efforts to build up military capabilities, 
as reflected in the EU launching its first military operation Monday 
by replacing NATO peacekeepers in Macedonia. However he cautioned 
European nations against initiatives that seek to duplicate or rival 
NATO structures. ``It would be very expensive and somewhat redundant 
to make two capabilities,'' Jones said. ^ (pa-rac) &lt;

Israel's foreign minister confirmed Tuesday, after meetings in Washington, 
that the United States is determined to publish its Mideast peace 
plan soon, and said Israel would seek changes before accepting it. 
The Israeli opposition leader, Amram Mitzna, and Palestinian officials 
said Israel is effectively rejecting the plan, a three-stage ``road 
map'' to Palestinian statehood by 2005. The Americans are ``determined 
to publish the road map,'' the foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, told 
Israel Army Radio on Tuesday, a day after meeting with U.S. President 
George W. Bush at the White House. Shalom laid down a number of conditions 
for the resumption talks with the Palestinians and said that ``the 
road map needs to be adapted.'' Israel has repeatedly said it accepts 
the ``Bush vision'' based on a broad-based policy speech delivered 
by the U.S. president on June 24, 2002, but has balked at embracing 
the road map _ drawn up by the United States, the European Union, 
Russia and The United Nations _ that outlines the implementation of 
the Bush vision. ``We expect that after the road map is published 
the first things they (the Palestinians) must do is halt the terror 
and the incitement,'' Shalom said. If the conditions are met, Israel 
would be a ``true partner, exploring all roads to peace,'' Shalom 
said. The road map envisions a Palestinian state in provisional borders 
by the end of the year. After a cease-fire is in place, Palestinians 
would have to work hard to rein in militants, while Israel would have 
to withdraw from Palestinian cities and freeze settlement construction. 
The United States and Britain have said the road map would be unveiled 
after the new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, and his new 
Cabinet are sworn in, probably sometime this month. Palestinian Cabinet 
Minister Saeb Erekat said Israel's demands for changes amount to a 
rejection of the plan. ``We had hoped that Mr. Shalom would have announced 
Israel's full commitment and acceptance of the road map. In reality 
he actually announced Israel's rejection,'' Erekat said. Israeli Labor 
Party Chairman Amram Mitzna said he suspected the Israeli government 
was playing for time. ``This is a recipe to say yes while in reality 
saying no,'' Mitzna told Army Radio. Also Tuesday, Israeli troops 
demolished the homes of five suspected Palestinian militants, including 
that of a suicide bomber who blew himself up in the coastal city of 
Netanya over the weekend. In the West Bank village of Deir Ghassoon 
near Tulkarem, forces destroyed the home of Rami Ghanem, 20 _ the 
Islamic Jihad bomber who blew up on Sunday at Cafe London in Netanya, 
wounding 49 people, the army said. Islamic Jihad said the bombing, 
the first since the U.S.-led war in Iraq began, was a ``gift'' to 
the Iraqi people and vowed to step up its attacks against Israel during 
the war. The group also said it had sent suicide bombers to Iraq to 
help fight American and British soldiers. In the Al Amari refugee 
camp near Ramallah, troops demolished four homes belonging to four 
suspected militants from one family, the Najis, the army said. The 
four were members of the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, a militia affiliated 
with Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. The Naji family is accused of 
carrying out and plotting a series of attacks on Israelis, the army 
said. The Najis participated in a shooting attack in a Tel Aviv restaurant 
in March 2002 in which three people were killed and another in Jerusalem 
in February 2002 in which a police officer was killed, the army said.

The European Union head office on Tuesday called the killing by U.S. 
soldiers of at least seven Iraqi women and children at a checkpoint 
in southern Iraq ``a horrible tragedy.'' It urged both forces on both 
sides of the war to spare civilian lives. ``No matter how advanced 
the technology in the hands of soldiers ... there is no such thing 
as an intelligent war,'' said European Commission spokesman Reijo 
Kemppinen. He also appealed to both sides to respect the Geneva convention 
on the fair and humane treatment of prisoners of war. On Monday, U.S. 
soldiers shot and killed at least seven Iraqi women and children at 
a checkpoint in southern Iraq. The U.S. military said the soldiers 
opened fire Monday when the driver of the van failed to stop as ordered.

SARS cases globally, 685 have been in Hong Kong. Separately, the Health 
Department said Tuesday a 30-year-old man with SARS symptoms had flown 
here from Bangkok aboard Thai Airways Flight TG606, and they wanted 
to locate all other passengers. The man became sick while he was staying 
in the Thai capital from March 25 to Saturday, but health officials 
in Hong Kong said they did not immediately know his nationality or 
where he contracted his illness. Global health officials say they 
have been worried by the spread of the illness by air travelers _ 
which is apparently how it moved from Hong Kong to Singapore, Canada 
and Vietnam, all of which have suffered deaths. Hong Kong officials 
said earlier Tuesday that four recreational activity camps could be 
turned into quarantine centers for 1,000 people, but they were only 
sending the people from Amoy Gardens to two of them.

Bennett King isn't certain he wants to become West Indies cricket 
coach and says the sport's national administrators had erred by announcing 
his appointment before completing contract negotiations with him. 
The West Indies board announced Monday that King, coach at the Australian 
Cricket Academy in Adelaide, had been appointed as Roger Harper's 
replacement in the West Indies job. King said the media had been informed 
of his pending appointment before he'd received a phone call from 
the Caribbean officials to confirm he was their preferred candidate. 
``They've nominated me as the preferred candidate and I haven't agreed 
to anything,'' King told the Australian Associated Press late Tuesday. 
``I've seen no terms or conditions.'' King, 38, said he was upset 
at the premature announcement. He applied for the job last December 
and had an interview last month. Asked if he would replace Harper, 
King replied: ``I'll tell you when they get some terms on the table.'' 
The Australian test squad flew out Monday for a four-test series against 
the West Indies in the Caribbean. Former test batsman Gus Logie was 
appointed interim coach for the West Indies and it was expected that 
King would take over in July. ``I believe the first week in July they're 
looking at me being there, but in terms of making a decision, I can't 
do anything until they give me something,'' said King. ``We'll wait 
and see. I need a bit more time to think about it all.'' Harper quit 
after the West Indies were ousted in the first round of the World 
Cup. King replaced current Australia coach John Buchanan in the Queensland 
coaching job in 1999/2000 Australian domestic season and then became 
head coach at the Australian Cricket Academy in March last year. The 
Australian Cricket Board said it was aware King had been offered the 
vacant West Indies position, but added that King was bound to coach 
the Australia A team against South Africa A in a tour match April 
11-13. (jp)

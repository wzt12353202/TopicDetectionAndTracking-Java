 only  a  third  World  Cup  .2002  In  particular,  is  aware  of 
 the  English  team  coach  Goran  Eriksson  to  take  any  faltering 
 Turkey  will  be  held  before  his  chances  of  it  elected  in 
 the  competition  for  the  group  has  been  mandated  by  his  card, 
 which  he  expressed  the  hope  to  follow  up  his  duties  at 
 the  top  of  the  technical  department  voter  held  after  English 
 until  the  end  of  the  World  Cup  2006  decision  in  Germany. 
 Ericsson  and  trained  English  team  found  it  very  difficult 
 to  restore  the  balance  since  quarter-final  exit  from  the 
 role  South  Korea  and  Japan  together  before  Brazil,  which 
 culminated  in  the  champion.  The  English  team  achieved  victory

 the  modest  2-0  last  Saturday,  noted  that  in  its  territory 
 lost  to  Australia  in  a  friendly  game  surrender  newspapers 
 on  honeymoon  with  Swedish  coach,  which  had  been  subjected 
 to  relentless  campaign.  This  is  due  to  the  ranks  of  the

 against  last  Saturday,  confirmed  the  participation  of  Liverpool 
 striker  Emile  Heskey  medication  after  the  injury  suffered 
 by  Saturday.  Heskey  faced  criticism  from  several  non-registered 
 a  record  50  goals  and  objectives  of  the  32  international 
 matches  so  far,  however,  that  his  colleague  in  Liverpool 
 star  Michael  Owen  he  defended  by  saying,  "against  Heskey 
 was  crucial  that  registered  owner  of  the  first  objective, 
 it  was  also  a  source  of  David  Beckham  free  to  record  their 
 second  goal,  in  particular,  the  free-kicks  catching  art  is 
 in  itself."  In  contrast,  achieved  a  Turkish  team,  which  observers 
 in  the  World  Cup  2002,  when  a  solution  to  the  third,  three 
 consecutive  victories  set  up  at  the  top  of  the  group  and 
 therefore  would  seek  to  follow-up  to  shine  and  return  positive 
 outcome  that  would  permit  him  to  stay  at  least  in  the  forefront. 
 He  said  trained  Grant  has  faced  English  weaker  team  (  ) 
 in  the  group  last  Saturday  very  modest  pace  of  play  in 
 order  to  maintain  their  efforts  to  focus  on  resolving  tomorrow, 
 "adding"  I  am  sure  that  they  would  wage  a  match  against 
 different  tomorrow  in  quite  the  contrary  ".  He  added:  "There 
 are  two  candidates  only  in  this  group  of  potential  competition, 
 and,  therefore,  similar  to  a  final  match  in  which,  if  we 
 have  not  been  able  to  win  the  tie  will  be  well."  It  is 
 noteworthy  that  the  Turkish  team  has  not  succeeded  so  far 
 in  the  registration  of  any  target  in  English  goal  in  the 
 history  of  clashes  between  elected  officials.  Group  a  match

 By  Stephane  Torrential  base  (Qatar)  4-1  (AFP)  -  shows  the 
 massacre  at  a  checkpoint  searched  seven  American  women  and 
 children  were  killed  in  the  tense  situation  experienced  by 
 Iraqi  soldiers  "alliance"  after  Iraqi  first  commando  operation 
 as  a  severe  blow  to  the  campaign  to  win  the  hearts  and 
 minds  of  the  people  of  Iraq.  It  was  the  shooting  of  civilians 
 at  a  checkpoint  on  the  road  near  Najaf  Inspection  (150  km 
 south  of  Baghdad)  in  the  same  region,  where  four  soldiers 
 were  killed  Saturday  when  the  dawn  of  the  American  side 
 Iraqi  officer  himself  in  a  taxi  to  an  American  military 
 checkpoint.  A  spokesman  of  the  U.S.  Central  Command  from 
 Charles  that  soldiers  "who  fired  warning  shots  in  the  air 
 and  then  as  a  measure  of  last  resort  opened  fire  on  the 
 structure  of  the  car.  When  they  opened  the  doors  had  found 
 13  women  and  a  baby.  Seven  dead  and  wounded  two  and  four 
 unharmed."  According  to  the  newspaper  +  Washington  Post  + 
 today,  it  might  be  caused  by  confusion  among  the  American 
 command  in  the  region  and  nervous  American  soldiers.  He  said 
 military  doctor  in  the  third  party  in  the  Marines  Mario 
 Manzano  (26  years  of  age)  newspaper:  "It  is  the  worst  tragedy 
 I  have  seen  in  my  life  I  hope  that  we  will  not  see  again." 
 He  added:  "left  one  woman  who  was  wounded  in  the  car,  has 
 embraced  by  rejecting  corpses  out."  And  the  opening  of  the 
 investigation  to  uncover  the  circumstances  of  the  incident. 
 However,  after  less  than  10  hours  of  the  massacre  was  considered 
 to  be  U.S.  Central  Command  in  a  statement  that  "Initial 
 reports  indicate  that  the  soldiers  acted  in  accordance  with 
 the  rules  adopted  to  protect  themselves."  The  statement  added: 
 "In  view  of  the  recent  terrorist  attacks  by  the  Iraqi  regime, 
 the  soldiers  had  exercised  considerable  degree  of  self-restraint 
 in  order  to  avoid  unnecessary  casualties  ".  American  and 
 British  criticize  the  leadership  of  the  war  on  Iraq  since 
 its  inception  means  "terrorist"  fighters,  who  are  fighting 
 against  Iraqi  civilian  dress  them  "death  squads"  denounced 
 the  Iraqi  commando  operation  with  the  blessing  of  the  highest 
 level  in  the  Iraqi  leadership.  According  to  the  American 
 command  that  it  had  made  its  best  to  protect  the  lives 
 of  civilians,  but  admit  that  it  would  resort  to  more  cautious. 
 82  party,  said  a  soldier  was  wounded  in  a  clash  with  Iraqi 
 fighters  who  were  travelling  in  trucks  and  ambulances  to 
 raise  the  waste  "this  makes  our  most  difficult.  We  must 
 carefully  before  opening  fire  second  half  of  the  second  or 
 whether  it  was  intended  as  a  friend  or  enemy  ".  In  any 
 case,  the  tragedy  Monday  is  another  blow  to  the  campaign 
 of  "alliance"  to  win  "the  hearts  and  minds  of  the  Iraqis 
 and  it  will  exacerbate  the  international  criticism  of  the 
 war  on  Iraq.  Now  felt  DuPont  of  the  Centre  for  Defence 
 and  Strategic  Studies  at  the  Australian  National  University 
 "Certainly  it  is  a  catastrophe  to  the  level  of  public  relations 
 drive  of  the  alliance  that  demonstrates  the  predicament  in 
 the  conduct  of  war.  If  they  appear  to  be  military  regain 
 the  initiative  would  require  a  lot  of  psychological  war  front." 
 Large-scale  operations  had  failed  to  materialize  to  escape 
 from  the  Iraqi  army  and  accepting  the  American  forces  "As 
 expected,  Washington  and  London  before  the  war.  Baghdad,  which 
 claimed  the  bombing  of  civilian  victims  of  large-scale,  was 
 due  to  the  forces  of  the  alliance,  which  says  it  has  cease-fire 
 because  of  inaccurate  defences  from  Iraq.  American  and  British 
 Iraqi  plan  is  based  on  the  abduction  to  "war  of  cities" 
 to  be  charged  with  pictures  of  the  forces  of  destruction, 
 civilian  victims  and  displaced  persons,  "alliance"  costly. 
 However,  the  political  leaderships  "alliance"  seeks  to  dispel 
 concern.  The  Ministry  of  Interior  acknowledged  the  David  British 
 Society  yesterday  evening,  Monday,  before  the  announcement 
 of  the  massacre  of  Najaf,  that  the  Iraqi  people  and  the 
 peoples  of  the  region  and  are  currently  considered  to  be 
 British  "",  but  the  situation  will  change"  after  it  becomes

 By  Michel  Haj  Dubai  4-1  (AFP)  -  different  statements  and 
 orientations  of  the  World  Cup  soccer  youth  (under  20  years), 
 which  was  scheduled  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  from  25 
 last  March  to  16  April  has  been  rescheduled  to  a  later 
 date,  but  explained  the  column  was  injured  in  one  of  the 
 United  Arab  Emirates  is  to  be  transported  to  another  state. 
 Accumulate  several  reasons  behind  this  interpretation  of  the 
 most  important  of  which  is  the  potential  effects  of  the 
 ongoing  war  on  Iraq,  and  the  difficulty  in  choosing  the 
 appropriate  time  for  the  finals  in  the  coming  period,  the 
 question  of  the  settling  of  accounts,  which  have  been  turned 
 into  fertile  material  in  the  media  specifically  Gulf,  United 
 Arab  Emirates.  Despite  the  fact  that  the  international  federation 
 (FIFA)  did  not  issue  a  formal  decision  until  the  championship 
 now  moving  to  another  country,  but  the  current  debate  on 
 this  matter  comes  after  a  statement  to  the  president  of 
 the  Asian  federation  FIFA  executive  committee  member  country 
 Agency  Mohamed  bin  Hammam,  "Agence  France  Presse"  personally, 
 he  stressed  that  he  would  prefer  that  the  movement  of  non-Asian 
 championship  to  another  country,  but  may  soon  because  elected 
 FIFA  decision  involved  must  be  aware  of  the  new  deadline 
 for  a  programme  appropriate  preparations.  It  must  be  recalled 
 that  the  World  Cup  after  all  these  facts  to  young  people 
 in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  was  the  beginning  of  a  victim 
 of  "the  repercussions  of  war  being  waged  by  the  United  States 
 and  Britain  on  Iraq,  which  began  nearly  two  weeks  prior 
 to  the  period  originally  identified  for  launching  signed  had 
 led  to  a  decision  in  the  past  6  postponement.  The  statement 
 by  the  president  of  the  United  Arab  Emirates  (UAE)  federation 
 football  World  Cup  youth  organization  chairman  Sheikh  Saeed 
 bin  Zayed  al-newspaper,  the  union-United  Arab  Emirates  (UAE) 
 on  Tuesday  that  it  is  not  optimistic  about  the  establishment 
 of  this  year  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  signed  the  first 
 of  the  declaration  of  an  immediate  access  to  the  transfer 
 of  the  championship.  He  also  addressed  the  issue  of  the 
 settling  of  accounts,  saying,  "Doubts  since  it  has  been  charged 
 with  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  International  Federation 
 of  both  the  Swiss  Joseph  Blatter  country  Mohamed  bin  Hammam, 
 in  its  last  meeting  on  6  March  last  year  to  determine  the 
 fate  of  the  World  Cup  2003,  in  particular  that  all  indications 
 are  that  the  two  specific  still  have  a  desire  to  settle 
 accounts  in  the  light  of  the  presidential  elections  set  apart 
 by  FIFA,  which  took  place  in  South  Korea  during  last  May." 
 The  United  Arab  Emirates  (UAE)  federation  gave  its  consent 
 to  support  Blatter  in  the  FIFA  elections  held  in  Korea  before 
 the  start  of  World  Cup  2002,  after  his  recent  visit  to 
 the  edge  on  the  sidelines  of  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  United 
 Arab  Emirates  (UAE),  but  the  situation  in  the  second  change 
 in  the  interest  of  the  candidate  of  the  presidency  of  the 
 Cameroonian  Issa  Hayatou  FIFA  president  of  the  African  federation. 
 The  question  of  the  new  deadline  comes  finals  increase  is 
 complex,  where  he  addressed  the  FIFA  asking  him  to  date 
 in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  (UAE)  Federation  does  not  run 
 counter  to  the  Heroisms  activities,  said  Sheikh  said  in  this 
 regard  in  the  most  recent  letter  FIFA  proposed  appointments 
 for  the  championship  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  the  first 
 at  the  beginning  of  next  September,  after  the  second  month 
 of  Ramadan,  however,  when  a  reason  not  to  be  optimistic. 
 "  Hammam  confirmed  its  commitment  to  the  position  should 
 be  established  in  the  state  of  non-Asian  Championship,  United 
 Arab  Emirates  to  preserve  their  right  to  organize  a  second 
 time  might  be  the  year  2005  or  .2007  he  said  that  there 
 could  be  organized  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  in  the  next 
 two  months,  because  no  one  knows  when  to  end  the  war,  and 
 also  refused  to  clash  with  the  holy  month  of  Ramadan.  Month 
 of  Ramadan  begins  in  the  last  week  of  October.  But  FIFA 
 crowded  with  a  calendar  of  events  championships  in  the  coming 
 period,  it  is  18  to  29  June  continents  Cup  host  France

 so  far  refused  to  allow  the  use  of  Turkish  territory  of 
 Iraq's  invasion  of  the  American  forces,  despite  the  support 
 of  the  Turkish  government,  therefore,  forcing  the  American 
 Department  of  Defense  (Pentagon)  to  review  its  plans  to  open

 Stephen  Coutts  Torrential  base  (Qatar),  4-1  (AFP)  -  Military 
 analysts  believed  that  the  siege  of  the  city  of  Basra  in 
 southern  Iraq,  Iraqi  Ringdove  over  a  week  ago  as  a  model 
 for  American  and  British  forces  could  be  reduced  if  Baghdad

 battle  that  -  Coalition  forces  with  the  elite  units  prepared 
 by  Iraqi  President  Saddam  Hussein  for  the  Defence  of  Baghdad. 
 According  to  the  British  forces  which  have  been  besieging 
 Basra  to  major  cities  in  southern  Iraq  after  500  km  from 
 the  Iraqi  capital,  is  about  to  capture  of  the  city  in  order 
 to  avoid  costly  street  battles.  Deliberate  British  forces 
 after  a  blockade  of  the  city  to  what  they  call  "surgical 
 strikes"  attacks  on  symbols  of  President  Saddam  Hussein's 
 regime.  It  might  be  a  picture  of  what  is  expected  to  be 
 the  scene  of  the  coalition  forces  on  the  eve  of  the  Baghdad. 
 Military  spokesman  Colonel  Chris  Ring  on  behalf  of  British 
 forces  in  Kuwait  said  on  Saturday  told  journalists  that  "the 
 bombing  attack  the  infrastructure  of  the  Baath  party  in  Basra 
 now  constitute  a  military  target  ".  The  British  tank  incursion

 local  TV,  which  used  by  the  ruling  Ba'ath  Party.  Civilians 
 on  behalf  of  the  British  forces  spokesman  said  "We  are  basically 
 operations  aimed  at  members  of  the  Baath  party  in  order 
 to  create  a  gap  between  the  regime  and  the  people  ".  At 
 a  time  when  the  infrastructure  in  Basra,  which  hit  the  British 
 forces  the  distribution  of  humanitarian  assistance  to  the 
 population  to  gain  sympathy.  The  General  Headquarters  of  the 
 Baath  Party  fell  on  Monday  evening  in  Basra,  which  is  located 
 in  the  neighbourhood  Baath  party,  said  British  troops  that 
 they  had  left  people  enter  the  headquarters  of  the  capture 
 of  food  are  stored.  In  this  regard,  the  British  erected 
 mobile  radio  broadcast  messages  in  Arabic  among  traditional 
 Arab  songs  while  another  regime  in  Iraq  stresses  that  the 
 days  are  numbered.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  acquisition 
 of  Basra,  will  be  the  first  great  victory  achieved  by  the 
 coalition  forces,  but  these  forces  after  nearly  two  weeks 
 on  the  first  bullet  failed  to  control  any  town,  despite 
 significant  progress  soldiers  Marines  in  desert  areas  did

 the  city  will  fall  on  its  own.  Rebel  forces,  but  there 
 were  no  Iraqi  ferocious  resistance  shown  to  the  coalition 
 forces.  The  Americans  paid  the  Shiites  to  rebellion  against 
 the  Iraqi  regime  after  the  end  of  the  second  Gulf  War  in

 By  Beatrice  Umm  Qasr  (Iraq)  4-1  (AFP)  -  After  nearly  two 
 weeks  to  wage  war  on  Iraq,  life  is  slowly  returning  to 
 normal  in  the  first  of  the  town  of  Umm  Qasr  Iraqi  under 
 the  control  of  the  American  and  British  forces,  which  began 
 in  the  port  activity  resumed  drinking  water  distribution  and 
 the  reform  of  the  electricity  grid.  Civil  protection  agencies 
 charged  with  the  British  army  in  a  difficult  task,  since 
 it  is  imperative  to  restore  calm  after  the  military  offensive 
 and  to  provide  a  minimum  of  well-being  to  a  strategic  port 
 of  Umm  Qasr  of  Iraq's  only  maritime  outlet  to  the  Gulf. 
 He  has  established  100  British  troops  stationed  in  the  hotel 
 in  this  city,  which  only  has  a  population  of  40  thousand 
 people,  which  date  back  to  life  with  difficulty.  These  soldiers 
 are  trying  to  organize  humanitarian  assistance  and  to  ensure 
 good  treatment  of  prisoners  of  war  and  the  injured,  and 
 the  families  of  those  killed  in  an  attack  by  an  American-British 
 coalition  and  the  restoration  of  family  reunification  and 
 to  link  the  war  and  the  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure. 
 Electricity  returned  to  the  Umm  Qasr  port  since  yesterday 
 evening  Monday  gradually  staff  returned  to  their  jobs.  It 
 is  expected  to  reach  ships  carrying  humanitarian  aid  as  promised 
 by  the  international  community  to  this  port,  which  has  so 
 far  been  carried  out  the  main  Iraqi  oil.  It  was  not  up 
 to  now  only  a  single  ship  delivered  humanitarian  aid.  The 
 official  in  charge  of  the  organs  of  the  Civil  Protection 
 of  the  British  army  Paul  Stanley  The  American  company  will 
 manage  the  port  of  Umm  Qasr  (currently  controlled  by  the 
 American  navy  infantry)  which  will  open  again  in  22  or  23 
 April,  "pointing  out  that  the  men  were  summoned  more  than 
 two  hundred  workers  for  the  resumption  of  the  works.  After 
 the  workers  were  paid  between  $2  and  three  dollars  in  the 
 day,  he  pointed  out  that  Stanley  wages  rise  with  the  arrival 
 of  new  employers,  reminding  that  60%  of  humanitarian  assistance 
 will  enter  into  Iraqi  territory  from  the  port  of  Umm  Qasr. 
 The  British  army  is  also  working  on  the  redeployment  of 
 the  drinking  water.  Military  official  said  that  the  current 
 water  had  been  transferred  from  Basra  through  the  network 
 of  pipes,  while  the  movement  of  drinking  water  in  trucks, 
 tanks  and  sold  to  the  population.  However,  the  entire  system 
 paralyzed  as  Basra  did  not  fall  so  far.  "  2  million  liters 
 of  water  to  arrived  in  Umm  Qasr  just  a  few  days  ago,  tanks 
 were  transported  in  trucks  from  Kuwait.  Apart  from  these 
 basic  needs,  the  main  problem  suffered  by  the  population 
 according  to  British  military  is  mistrust  and  fear.  He  said: 
 "ask  why  schools  still  closed  and  shops.  The  reason  is  that 
 the  city  are  not  so  far  safer  place  for  residents  who  want 
 to  overthrow  the  regime  of  verification  before  anything  (Saddam 
 Hussein)  once  and  for  all."  Other  testimony,  however,  it 
 was  reported  that  the  arrival  of  alliance  soldiers  suspicion 
 is  the  reason  for  the  Iraqis.  In  order  to  restore  stability 
 in  southern  Iraq,  intends  to  organs  of  the  Civil  Protection 
 of  the  British  army  cooperation  with  local  authorities.  Stanley 
 said  that  "the  long-term  goal  is  to  form  a  civilian  administration." 
 The  main  obstacle  to  achieving  this  objective  is  to  exist 
 in  favour  of  the  regime  of  Saddam  Hussein.  However,  this 
 does  not  worry  British  military,  which  says  that  "some  of 
 the  leaders  of  the  Baath  party  (the  governor  in  Baghdad) 
 left,  others  are  still  here."  It  was  expected  to  reach  the 
 first  mission  of  the  United  Nations  on  Monday  to  Umm  Qasr 
 to  lay  the  groundwork  for  the  return  of  UNICEF  and  the 
 World  Food  Programme  of  the  United  Nations.  But  /  /  R  R

 By  Francis  Washington  4-1  (AFP)  -  When  it  was  opened  for 
 his  home  at  3.00  a.m.  to  see  that  officers  of  the  marines, 
 they  Michael  waters  -  immediately  what  is  happening  to  me: 
 I  have  learned  that  it  would  be  his  son,  who  was  killed 
 on  the  front  again  Iraq.  A  sergeant  in  the  province  have 
 been  killed  and  at  the  Battalion  268  of  the  third  party, 
 which  would  lead  helicopter  crashed  in  southern  Iraq  in  the 
 second  day  battles.  It  is  one  of  the  first  four  dead  in 
 the  war  and  the  first  element  of  black  Americans  serving. 
 Television  networks,  which  in  the  face  of  the  small  salon 
 in  the  family  home,  in  a  suburb  of  Baltimore  (east),  carrying 
 Michael  waters  -  Me  48-year-old  image  of  his  son  al-Bakr. 
 It  was  a  beautiful  boy,  who  had  spent  29  of  which  is  a 
 matter  of  pride  age.  He  said  the  angry  tone,  "I  want  to 
 see  George  Bush,  the  look  good.  It  was  only  son,  breaking 
 the  largest  taboo  in  the  United  States  in  wartime  any  criticism 
 of  the  president.  He  did  not  believe  that  Saddam  Hussein 
 is  posing  a  direct  threat,  but  believed  that  the  crisis 
 could  be  resolved  peacefully,  without  sacrificing  the  lives 
 of  his  son  and  that  the  war  did  not  launch  only  "for  oil, 
 which  was  questioned  on  the  status  of  these  helicopters  dating 
 back  to  Vietnam  War,  however,  continue  to  be  used.  According 
 to  the  American  state  to  provide  an  explanation  of  what 
 has  happened.  "  According  to  his  daughter  Michel  shed  tears 
 at  the  "All  this  for  nothing  It  was  possible  to  avoid  this 
 war.  Now  lost  my  brother  while  Bush  has  not  lost  his  brother. 
 "  The  killing  of  the  province  has  received  wide  echo  black 
 Americans.  According  to  a  recent  poll,  61  percent  of  blacks 
 were  opposed  to  the  war  in  Iraq  (78  percent  of  whites  support). 
 Many  of  the  black  figures  have  been  taken,  or  of  parliamentarians, 
 the  position  of  anti-war  against  Iraq,  including  the  Assembly 
 of  the  promotion  of  colour.  According  to  the  expert  in  political 
 affairs  Ron  Walters  Blacks  always  say  that  there  is  also 
 time  enough  money  for  housing,  education  and  rehabilitation 
 of  human  beings,  while  there  is  a  huge  funds  earmarked  for 
 war  and  reconstruction  of  Iraq.  "  Black  minority,  which  suffers 
 from  high  rate  of  unemployment  is  still  considered  a  factor 
 in  the  army  and  the  evolution  of  the  great  social  integration, 
 as  it  is  a  guarantee  for  the  rehabilitation  and  even  professional 
 university  diploma  granting  social  assistance,  health  insurance, 
 insurance,  housing  and  others.  While  not  a  black  Americans 
 only  12.7  percent  of  the  population,  but  they  constitute 
 22  percent  of  the  American  army  several  (component  1.4  million) 
 and  constitute  26  percent  of  the  many  weapons  land  and  18 
 percent  of  the  many  navy.  However,  they  are  the  least  twice 
 the  number  of  whites  who  wish  to  enrolling  in  primary  grades 
 in  the  fighting.  In  the  sea,  for  example,  black  holds  32 
 percent  of  the  administrative  functions  of  specialists.  This 
 can  be  explained  "voluntary  separation"  that  blacks  would 
 prefer  to  go  to  the  logistical  support  or  administrative 
 functions  which  are  more  easily  accessible  in  the  job  market, 
 as  was  David  exceed  the  expert  in  social  affairs  at  the 
 University  of  Maryland.  He  said:  "There  is  a  lot  of  enterprises 
 that  employ  people  because  they  know  how  shooting  ".  Also, 
 the  Iraqi  Johnson  American  first  arrest,  which  is  also  considering 
 the  Vocational  Rehabilitation  through  its  accession  to  the 
 army.  This  is  very  black  aged  30  years,  or  non-married  girl 
 amounting  to  two  years  of  age,  joined  the  army  because  they 
 want  to  become..  When  it  joined  the  Artillery  Battalion  111 
 concentrated  in  Fort  Bliss  (South  Texas,)  One  of  the  family 
 did  not  suggest  that  they  might  find  themselves  days  in 
 the  battle  front  nor  has  it  ever  comes  to  mind  that  it 
 might  fall  captive  in  the  hands  of  Iraqis.  Instructed  /

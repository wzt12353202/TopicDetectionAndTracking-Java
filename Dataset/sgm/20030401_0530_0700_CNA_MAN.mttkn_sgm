 isolation  and  the  dispatch  of  a  large  number  medical  personnel, 
 police  officers  and  other  staff  at  the  scene,  including  for 
 disinfection  and  tracing  virus  sources.  Secretary  for  Health, 
 Welfare  and  food  Yang  Yongqiang,  the  follow-up,  with  the 
 virus  PWH,  since  one  block  E  residents  have  repeatedly  visited 
 the  hospital  to  the  families  of  sick,  I  believe  that  by 
 the  virus  is  spreading.  But  the  authorities  headache,  why 
 HIV  is  spreading  fast,  and  the  most  affected  households  living 
 in  the  same  direction.  When  Yang  Yongqiang  SARS  was  asked 
 about  the  possible  spread  through  the  air,  has  also  begun 
 to  show  a  hesitated,  claimed  that  they  would  not  exclude 
 the  possibility  to  abandon  its  earlier  position  maintained 
 by  the  virus  from  respiratory  droplets  spread.  Calculated 
 from  the  10th  of  this  month  to  31  pm,  the  SARS  infected 
 cases  have  been  610  cases,  the  death  toll  increases  to  15 
 the  spread  of  the  virus  is  not  the  so-called  slow  pace 
 is  cause  for  concern.  Some  recent  public  opinion  pointed 
 out  that  although  the  virus  in  the  event  which  was  unprecedented 
 and  very  worrying  and  some  panic  but  the  most  important 
 is  that  the  government  and  all  Hong  Kong  people  calmly  dealt 
 with  it,  they  are  not  overly  panic  and  chaos,  so  as  not 
 to  throw  ourselves  into  confusion.  In  fact,  the  crisis  so 
 far,  although  Hong  Kong  people  apparently  fear  that  with 
 the  virus,  but  not  for  confusion  and  even  rare  unanimous 
 support  to  the  government  to  contain  the  virus.  Last  week 
 the  government  announced  a  curb  SARS  measures,  including  eight 
 major  political  parties  against  the  government  has  always 
 been  very  few  in  the  Democratic  Party  and  Front-line  stand 
 on  the  same  front.  In  addition,  they  unanimously  support 
 the  government's  blockade  block  E,  and  not  as  happy  as  the 
 previous  government  to  look  for  trouble.  To  this  end,  the 
 Chief  Executive  Tung  Chee-hwa  31  SARS  evening  on  the  latest 
 situation  in  more  than  worried  that  it  is  particularly  grateful 
 to  all  the  people  in  this  incident  government  measures  to 
 support  and  assistance.  The  opinion  that  the  government  as 
 soon  as  possible  to  contain  virus  spread  further  to  the 
 community.  Otherwise,  once  Cases  Surge  in  curbing  public  panic 
 about  the  mood  in  mind,  I  am  afraid  would  eventually  broke 
 out.

 has  been  hit  by  almost  two  weeks  of  Iraqi  war  and  until 
 now  there  is  no  end  in  sight,  away  from  battlefield  in 
 the  Italian  parliament  is  to  really  anti-war,  is  not  anti-American, 
 anti-Bush,  and  did  not  support  Iraq,  support  Saddam,  set 
 off  a  wave  and  a  wave  of  internal  disputes.  Italy's  largest 
 leftist  trade  unions  CGIL  forces  in  Iraq  fought  a  war,  the 
 first  day  of  the  strike  launched  a  nationwide  protest  action 
 to  express  their  anti-war  position  in  the  ruling  right-wing 
 union  there  was  no  response  had  been  expected.  But  the  leftist 
 alliance  of  opposition  parties,  but  in  order  to  explain  how 
 anti-war  stance,  tough.  The  president  of  the  union  in  CGIL 
 knowledge,  so-called  anti-war  is  not  supported  by  Britain 
 and  the  United  States,  and  does  not  support  Iraq.  However, 
 other  opposition  parties  have  different  views:  it  was  against 
 the  use  of  force  against  Iraq  and  it  was  anti-US;  it  was 
 only  anti-Bush,  Blair,  and  it  was  only  anti-Saddam.  For  example, 
 what  are  the  members  of  the  opposition  in  Congress  will 
 not  stand  against  the  United  States,  and  civil  peace  idea 
 is  that  the  United  States  and  Britain  as  a  breach  of  the 
 peace  cause.  Currently  the  largest  problem  is  that  the  Italian 
 opposition  parties  lack  a  clear  consensus,  the  clear  understanding 
 of  supporters.  Therefore,  when  Iraq  war  more  than  10  days 
 in  Italy  on  a  rotating  basis  in  many  large  cities  almost 
 protest  activities.  On  the  surface,  it  was  to  give  peace 
 a  flag,  shouting  anti-war  population.  In  fact,  the  organizers 
 position,  the  target  of  anti-real  different.  Recently,  opposition 
 coalition,  also  faced  another  challenge  is:  how  to  hold  the 
 war  against  the  opposition  to  Bush  Youngest  ?  come  to  an 
 end  to  end  the  war,  and  to  continue  to  oppose  the  government's 
 involvement  in  reconstruction  of  Iraq.  Xu  Duoyi  big  ride 
 out  public  opinion,  the  leftist  union  from  two  years  ago 
 lost  the  election,  there  is  no  proper  integration,  a  true 
 leader.  These  problems  will  not  be  solved  in  time,  they 
 are  afraid  they  will  not  play  the  function  of  the  opposition 
 will  only  make  the  ruling  coalition  in  the  relevant  issues 
 to  be  taken.

 severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)  of  the  disease  causes 
 and  treatment  methods.  At  the  present  time  finding  two  possible 
 causes  disease  virus  vice  Nien  (Paramyxovirus)  and  coronavirus 
 (Coronavirus).  If  the  causes  of  disease,  it  will  be  very 
 rapid  development  of  a  case  management  and  epidemiological 
 investigation  of  diagnostic  tools.  Who  believes  that  there 
 is  no  indication  that  "severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)" 
 biochemical  terror  are  the  results  of  the  war.  The  Seasonal 
 climate  does  not  matter.  Who  regional  advisor  infectious  disease 
 inspection  and,  in  Oshitani  Yan  said  that  once  found  SARS 
 arising  from  the  disease,  may  seek  to  diagnosis  and  treatment. 
 The  Who  Western  Pacific  SARS  Response  Team  Coordination  Officer 
 Valley  Yan  pointed  out  that  the  charges  as  a  result  of 
 the  global  air  travel  in  a  short  period  of  time  the  infectious 
 disease  spread  to  many  countries.  But  if  there  is  a  good 
 protection  measures,  SARs  are  not  highly  infectious  disease, 
 resulting  in  death  rate  is  not  high,  about  10%  condition 
 to  worsen,  the  mortality  rate  to  around  4%  90%  six  to  seven 
 days  patients  can  recover.  He  suggested  that  can  use  of 
 antibiotics,  but  that  does  not  cure,  but  the  second  transmission 
 prevention  to  SARs.  He  noted  that  the  new  diseases  need 
 to  find  the  causes  of  morbidity,  can  there  be  a  medical 
 treatment,  which  depend  on  international  cooperation.  It  is 
 hoped  that  this  process  can  be  accelerated.  At  present,  there 
 are  11  countries  of  the  nine  laboratory  is  a  center  for 
 research  projects.  The  two  may  have  to  find  the  causes  of 
 disease  virus  vice  Nien  (Paramyxovirus)  and  coronavirus  (Coronavirus). 
 Once  poliovirus,  would  soon  develop  case  management  and  epidemiological 
 investigation  of  diagnostic  tools.  He  also  said  that  the 
 Chinese  mainland  has  agreed  to  provide  the  spread  of  SARS 
 information,  but  it  needs  to  be  from  the  mainland  provinces 
 access  to  relevant  information.  The  mainland  is  in  the  process 
 of  establishing  a  system,  from  the  provinces  to  collect  information 
 spread  of  SARS  to  World  Health  Organization.  Who  does  not 
 recommend  to  all  parts  of  the  world  travel.  However,  all 
 travel  should  understand  the  symptoms  of  SARs.  SARS  had  symptoms, 
 and  was  diagnosed  as  suffering  from  the  SARs  have  close 
 contacts  or  travel  to  the  SARS  endemic  areas  should  seek 
 medical  treatment.  The  travel  if  the  symptoms  of  Sars  in 
 rehabilitation  before  not  to  travel.  Oshitani  Yan,  who  is 
 through  global  outbreak  of  diseases  early  warning  and  response 
 Network  (GlobalOutbreak  Alert  and  ResponseNetwork)  partners 
 to  cooperate  in  tracking  the  SARs,  and  coordinated  rapid

 and  benefit  contribution  crowd  that  Taiwan  is  seeking  to

 Roving  ambassador  in  the  Republic  of  China  Wu  Shumin,  and 
 the  Republic  of  China  Medical  Association  national  federation 
 chairman  Wu  Yundong,  as  well  as  legislator  Chao  Dong  accompanied 
 by  a  short,  this  evening  from  "Taipei  Representative  stationed 
 in  South  Korea  department"  representative  in  eastern  Seoul 
 to  Li  Zongru  front  of  the  railway  station  Chinese  restaurant 
 "have  many  neighbors"  and  his  senior  journalists  at  a  dinner 
 hosted  for  Taiwan's  position  to  join  the  World  Health  Organization 
 (who)  made  the  statement.  Wu  Shumin  stressed  that  "Taiwan's 
 medical  community  Alliance"  To  visit  to  Geneva  from  1997 
 through  to  lobby  for  who,  because  of  the  Chinese  authorities' 
 obstruction  and  pressure,  has  failed  to  break-through,  who 
 has  been  out  of  the  international  quarantine  network,  the 
 international  joint  network  against  the  disease  there  is  a 
 big  loopholes  in  the  international  exchange  peak  times,  it 
 is  a  major  international  health  work  gap.  He  told  reporters 
 at  a  dinner  hosted  by  South  Korea,  had  originated  in  China's 
 Guangdong  province,  spread  rapidly  in  Hong  Kong,  Vietnam, 
 Singapore,  Taiwan,  Southeast  Asia,  even  as  far  away  and  Canadian 
 severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS),  is  now  such  excitement 
 spread  international  and  more  than  10  countries,  due  to  the 
 Chinese  authorities  who  failed  to  abide  by  norms  Charter 
 obligations,  the  unauthorized  hide  world  single-handedly  concealing 
 disease  that  led  to  the  current  serious  situation.  Wu  Shumin 
 pointed  out  that  in  today's  South  Korea  and  China  bilateral 
 personnel  frequent  close  communication  with,  it  is  difficult 
 to  avoid  SARS  incursion  into  South  Korea.  The  "Taiwan's  medical

 The  Republic  of  China  roving  ambassador,  and  the  Republic 
 of  China  Medical  Association  national  federation  chairman  Wu 
 Yundong  revealed  that  the  Republic  of  China  in  31  years 
 ago  out  of  the  United  Nations,  Taiwan  has  never  had  the 
 chance  to  who  played  a  role.  The  government  and  the  constant 
 efforts  of  doctors,  Taiwan's  medical  technology  has  become 
 advanced  standards,  malaria,  polio  eradication  in  Taiwan  have 
 been  successively  for  AIDS  prevention  work,  Taiwan  has  been 
 confirmed  by  the  international  community,  the  standard  of 
 Taiwan's  public  health  has  been  sufficient  to  allow  Taiwan's 
 medical  service  of  the  international  community,  going  out, 
 however,  when  Taiwan's  medical  mission  to  Africa  to  assist 
 the  local  population  against  malaria,  was  opposed  by  the 
 Chinese  authorities,  and  suffered  a  setback.  Wu  Yundong,  the 
 Global  Village  in  major  diseases,  when  Taiwan's  medical  community 
 to  who  requests  for  information  and  assistance,  often  by 
 refusing  to  the  outside,  are  run  by  the  United  States  Centers 
 for  Disease  Control  (CDC)  to  assist  Taiwan,  who  may  wish 
 to  see  Taiwan  as  the  United  States  Centers  for  Disease  Control 
 as  part  of  it  is  31,000  in  Taiwan's  doctor  shame.  Wu  Yundong, 
 who  will  be  Taiwan's  exclusion  from  the  disease  prevention 
 network,  denied  being  a  global  village  residents  of  living 
 in  Taiwan's  23  million  people's  rights  and  obligations,  it 
 is  very  unfair,  who  should  not  be  overly  politicized  and 
 should  take  a  charter  for  the  Earth  villagers  public  health, 
 peace  in  the  world  join  hands  to  move  forward.  He  also 
 disclosed  that  the  Chinese  authorities  have  in  the  World 
 Conference  on  doctors,  23  million  Taiwan  people's  health  immunization 
 care  by  the  government  of  China,  Taiwan  had  no  need  to 
 who,  for  the  Chinese  authorities  such  fallacies  and  lies, 
 has  been  caring  for  22  million  Taiwan  people  and  the  birth 
 of  more  than  31,000  medical  doctors  all  forms  of  protest. 
 Wu  Yundong,  Congress  has  the  support  for  Taiwan's  entry  to 
 who  the  bill,  the  EU  parliament  last  year  also  expressed 
 their  support,  Japan  in  March  last  year  by  the  declarations 
 of  support,  the  international  doctors  will  also  has  a  consensus, 
 the  South  Korean  doctors  groups  and  non-governmental  organizations 
 also  expressed  support  for  Taiwan's  entry  to  who's  position, 
 only  to  the  administration,  have  refused  to  support  Taiwan's 
 participation,  we  Taiwan  is  that  the  international  quarantine 
 health  work  contributing  a  energy.  Doctors  origin  legislator 
 Chao  Chien  Tung  first  the  rapid  spread  of  Sars  symptoms, 
 as  well  as  supporting  Taiwan's  disease  prevention,  and  then 
 stressed  that  Taiwan  from  the  outside  world  vaccination  in 
 endless  international  exchanges  with  the  current  situation, 
 ultimately,  there  is  no  benefit  to  South  Korea.  Chao  Chien 
 Tung  stressed  that  although  China  who  member  states,  who 
 did  not  comply  with  the  concealment  epidemic  disease  prevention 
 standards,  and  Taiwan  is  not  who  member  states,  but  who 
 want  to  abide  by  constitution,  based  on  humanitarian  grounds, 
 medical  care  without  boundaries,  regional  security,  hope  that 
 South  Korean  authorities  to  support  Taiwan's  accession  to 
 who.  Chien  Chao  says  that  if  the  government  feared  the  pressure 
 on  China,  and  at  least  by  the  parliament  resolution  proposal 
 to  support  Taiwan's  accession  to  who.  In  the  evening  banquet,

 World  Trade  Organization  today  also  suffered  major  setbacks. 
 The  145  member  states  in  the  crucial  negotiations  on  agriculture, 
 unable  to  reach  any  consensus  within  the  period,  the  WTO 
 negotiations  on  agriculture  is  one  of  the  most  important 
 items,  the  Doha  round  the  successful  process  forward  is  casting 
 a  shadow  on.  The  council  of  ministers  in  Doha  Declaration, 
 the  WTO  should  be  on  March  31  agreement  before  the  negotiations 
 on  agriculture  model,  but  in  fact,  in  the  28th  had  collapsed. 
 Today's  meeting  in  picking  up  aftermath  and  hope  to  have 
 a  clear  future  to  continue  negotiations.  The  meeting  came 
 a  week,  delegates  have  been  repeating  the  same  old  tune. 
 I  feel  less  than  a  willingness  to  compromise.  The  president 
 of  the  conference  recognized  Amazon  Harbin,  the  meeting  could 
 not  have  any  progress  is  a  "defeat  ",  the  WTO  secretary-general 
 Patrick  Su  guess  also  feel  extremely  disappointed  and  their 
 attitude  also  highlights  the  seriousness  of  agricultural  negotiations 
 fail.  Although  Harbin  less  said  that  today's  setback  is  not 
 everything,  many  countries  have  demonstrated  the  will  and 
 commitment  to  reach  an  agreement.  But  the  differences  in 
 fact,  its  position  that  most  people  do  not  see  June  sub-return 
 to  the  negotiating  table  will  be  the  major  changes.  He  also 
 acknowledged  that  the  reduction  of  tariffs  for  many  of  the 
 key  issues  such  as  the  Council  of  Ministers  in  September, 
 could  only  be  resolved.  In  other  words,  than  the  original 
 agenda  to  be  postponed  at  least  six  months.  WTO  member  states 
 once  again  this  week  to  return  to  the  negotiating  table 
 in  the  hope  that  a  week's  meeting  of  the  Harbin  less  "negotiations 
 on  agriculture  revised  edition  model"  consensus-building  element, 
 but  they  are  not  on  market  access,  cut  export  subsidies 
 and  support  in  the  three  pillars  subject  to  technical  problems 
 have  major  differences,  more  importantly,  there  is  no  initiative 
 member  states  are  willing  to  compromise,  and  concessions. 
 Harbin  has  thus  become  less  critical  of  the  main  target, 
 which  he  is  to  be  calm.  He  said  that  in  this  going  south 
 by  driving  the  chariot  north  for  the  draft  naturally  become 
 the  target  of  public  criticism,  he  is  the  greatest  feeling 
 not  to  be  elected  president.  Taiwan  delegation  owners  can 
 we  talk,  the  Council  of  Agriculture  international  cooperation 
 Commissioner  Wang  Minglai  said  that  although  has  been  expected 
 that  negotiations  will  not  be  successful,  would  be  unlikely 
 to  be  progress,  but  member  states  to  such  an  outcome  or 
 regret.  Taiwan  to  the  negotiations  in  the  patterns  of  tariff 
 concessions,  mainly  concerned  with  issues  such  as  tariff  quotas, 
 have  made  it  clear  that  they  could  not  accept  the  position. 
 Wang  Ming  in  this  week's  meeting  was  also  repeatedly  said 
 that  if  the  "ambitious  model"  was  adopted,  small-scale  farmers 
 and  many  member  states  will  henceforth  agricultural  sustainable 
 development.  He  was  at  the  end  of  the  meeting  today  in 
 his  statement  and  reiterated  the  position  of  Taiwan,  stressing 
 that  Taiwan  supported  the  objectives  of  agricultural  trade 
 liberalization,  but  the  practice  should  be  flexible  in  a 
 gradual  manner.  Wang  Ming  also  thanked  Harbin  less  to  accept 
 new  member  states  should  have  a  longer  period  to  adapt  the 
 position.

 Aboriginal  Cultural  Relics,  when  they  were  watching  end  Yami 
 boards  the  boat  after  work  hard  to  come  to  Yoroko  trousers 
 in  front,  explaining  the  indigenous  people  in  particular, 
 that  hope  one  day  to  President  Chen  Yooroko  wearing  trousers 
 public  appearances,  the  president  said  that  direct,  today 
 is  a  fool,  drew  laughter  to  the  whole  chamber.  An  earlier 
 statement  by  President  Chen  pointed  out  that  today,  I  am 
 very  pleased  at  the  Presidential  Palace  personally  welcome 
 to  the  Cabinet  Committee  on  Aboriginal  people  organized  by 
 the  "aboriginal  peoples  impression  brigade"  Exhibition  Opens 
 in  the  hope  that  through  the  media's  interest  to  attract 
 more  people  to  visit  the  exhibition  of  great  significance. 
 He  said  that  since  the  Public  Service,  there  have  always 
 hoped  for  Aboriginal  people  for  more  care  and  services,  which 
 is  not  only  because  aboriginal  peoples  in  today's  society 
 is  a  small  and  weak,  and  aboriginal  peoples  as  well  as 
 the  fact  that  Taiwan  is  the  first  masters  of  the  land, 
 as  well  as  the  richest  source  of  Taiwan's  Cultural  and  artistic 
 treasures.  President  Chen  stressed  that  over  the  past  because 
 the  error  of  perspective  and  with  the  many  historical  and 
 political  factors  accelerating  wrongly  believe  that  the  aboriginal 
 peoples  assimilation  and  Chinese  localization  is  their  best 
 to  help  aboriginal  peoples  caused  the  collapse  of  the  structures 
 of  society  and  culture  faults  and  the  loss  of  their  mother 
 tongue,  causing  aboriginal  peoples  ethnic  identity  and  economic 
 life  is  not  all,  this  is  what  the  government,  not  even 
 a  deep  reflection  on  the  Taiwan  society  to  work  together 
 to  place.  The  indigenous  people,  the  president  said  that 
 he  has  many  indigenous  people,  are  frequently  invited  to 
 guest,  indigenous  people  feel  the  warmth  and  hospitality, 
 we  always  get  the  best  thing  to  entertain  guests.  It  is 
 easy  to  see  all  the  pristine  national  character,  there  is 
 really  the  sincerity  and  goodwill  of  the  warmth,  so  natural. 
 He  constantly  remind  ourselves  that  in  order  to  cherish  all 
 the  land  in  Taiwan,  we  must  help  aboriginal  peoples  back 
 to  the  historical  memory  loss,  as  well  as  major  human  dignity, 
 on  the  fault  lines  and  ambiguous  or  marginalized,  we  must 
 make  the  greatest  possible  to  restore  the  original  look. 
 President  Chen  Shui-bian  said  that  Taiwan  is  a  multi-ethnic 
 state,  not  only  a  Han  nationality.  Taiwan's  great  and  beautiful, 
 but  also  to  have  a  very  inclusive.  Therefore,  whether  aboriginal 
 peoples,  Taiwanese  and  mainland  ethnic  Hakka  or  should  be 
 opened  in  the  heart  of  the  fence,  abandon  their  original 
 ethnic  prejudice  and  suspicion,  they  take  shelter  in  Taiwan 
 this  piece  of  land  a  life  together,  sharing,  coexistence 
 and  common  prosperity.  When  the  Taiwan  rapidly  taken  significant 
 strides  forward,  we  are  also  to  keep  back  to  indigenous 
 ethnology,  study  and  learn  to  respect  nature  and  learn  to 
 care  for  land,  more  importantly,  learn  to  respect  and  tolerance 
 of  different  cultures.  This  is  the  21st  Century  "new  Taiwanese" 
 should  have.  In  recent  years,  since  all  the  support  and 
 encouragement,  the  president  said  that  the  government  continued 
 to  seek  opportunities  for  indigenous  people  hope  to  do  more. 
 For  example:  the  presidential  palace  in  front  of  the  Chieh-shou 
 road  would  be  renamed  Al-Qaeda  cells  Lan  Dadao,  because  Ketagalan 
 is  Taipei's  first  aboriginal  peoples  and  in  Taiwan  art  history, 
 organized  the  first  aboriginal  peoples  of  the  art  exhibits 
 and  recognition  of  Taiwan  art  forms  from  the  indigenous  peoples 
 and  the  arts,  construction  planning  aboriginal  peoples  theme 
 park,  selected  in  the  Palace  Museum  side,  we  must  remind 
 everyone  to  understand  Chinese  culture,  also  not  forget  that 
 Taiwan's  prehistoric  culture.  President  Chen  Shui-bian  said 
 that  the  government  also  assisted  for  aboriginal  peoples' 
 intellectual  property  rights,  and  in  the  official  boarded 
 the  position  of  international  solidarity;  and  the  National 
 Aboriginal  art  for  the  presidential  guest  to  grant  the  gift, 
 the  Presidential  Office  of  the  interview  room  and  in  particular, 
 the  aboriginal  peoples  totem  for  decoration,  and  even  in 
 the  presidential  inauguration  ceremony  and  the  national  anthem 
 sung  to  Zhang  Hui-mei,  these  efforts,  which  is  to  highlight 
 Aboriginal  peoples  to  enrich  the  cultural  characteristics. 
 Because  of  the  aboriginal  peoples  in  this  beautiful  land, 
 Taiwan  groups  more  diversified,  and  more  rich  and  splendid 
 culture.  Today's  display  very  excellent,  and  the  people  to 
 "aboriginal  peoples  impression  brigade"  as  the  theme,  also 
 has  special  meaning.  President  Chen  expressed  the  hope  that 
 with  the  exhibition,  so  that  we  recognize  that  the  greatest 
 ethnic  groups,  in  the  past  to  reposition  the  impression  of 
 stereotypes  and  believe  that  when  we  have  come  after  the 
 exhibition  gallery  of  the  aboriginal  peoples  must  have  different 
 understanding  and  views.

 she  stressed  that  Beijing's  so-called  one  China  "is  an  old 
 one-China,  her  new  One-China  deal  means  that  we  recognize 
 that  there  is  only  one  China  in  the  world,  and  China  was 
 the  sole  representative,  but  we  do  not  recognize  Taiwan  as 
 part  of  China.  The  framework  of  the  cross-strait  relations,

 conclusion  that  there  is  only  one  China  in  the  world  and 
 Taiwan  is  part  of  China,  and  China  is  the  sole  representative 
 of  the  old  one-China,  but  she  was  the  one-China  new  theory

 China  now,  immediately  followed  by  China,  and  she  had  long 
 advocated  could  accept  the  one  China,  but  not  to  accept

 China  is  the  sole  legitimate  government  representing  China

 reported  today  Israel's  independence,  while  the  United  States 
 warned  that  Syria  has  over  the  past  few  days  to  allow  Iraq 
 to  fight  against  the  American  invasion  of  the  CPV  smoothly 
 through  the  border.  Most  of  Syria,  thousands  of  volunteers 
 was  rushed  to  the  north  of  Iraq  Mosul  and  Kirkuk  region. 
 Reports  from  Lebanon  first  is  the  main  Palestinian  refugee 
 camps  in  dozens  of  volunteers,  Damascus  immediately  let  them 
 through  its  control  of  the  border  crossing  into  Iraq,  Syria 
 became  the  first  to  allow  volunteers  crossed  the  border  into 
 Iraq.  This  situation  has  continued  to  a  United  States  aircraft 
 fired  missiles  hit  Iraq's  Volunteers  riding  a  bus,  one  Zao 
 Chengwu  passengers  were  killed.  Independent  newspaper,  the 
 Syrian  authorities  recently  have  been  invited  to  the  border 
 with  Iraq  foreign  reporter  Qian  Wang  Two  customs  inspection, 
 claiming  that  they  have  been  closed.  "Now  it  seems  that 
 this  seems  to  be  a  pretty  deceptive  practices.  The  paper 
 pointed  out  that  the  volunteers  have  been  taken  to  points 
 away  from  the  Syrian  border  areas,  and  then  allowed  through 
 the  border  crossing  on  foot  and  then  boarded  the  trucks 
 waiting  on  the  Iraqi  side,  there  is  no  military  activities 
 through  the  route  to  Mosul  and  Kirkuk  region.  At  present

 to  Iraq  mainly  from  Palestinian  refugee  camps  in  Lebanon 
 and  Lebanese  people,  along  with  the  numbers  of  volunteers, 
 the  Syrian  people  are  more  and  more.  It  is  estimated  that 
 the  Chinese  People's  Volunteers  entering  Iraq  have  been  thousands 
 of  people.  Iraqi  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Adzi  two  days  before 
 the  interview,  said  that  about  4,000  volunteers  from  various 
 Arab  countries  have  arrived  in  Iraq.  He  did  not  specify 
 which  countries,  currently  known  as  the  Islamic  Republic  of 
 Iran,  Jordan  and  Turkey  volunteers  would  be  allowed  to  cross 
 the  border  into  Iraq.  U.S.  Defense  Secretary  Donald  Rumsfeld 
 accused  Damascus  several  days  ago  deliveries  of  weapons  to 
 Iraq,  but  he  did  not  refer  to  volunteers.  The  United  States 
 has  once  again  yesterday  warned  Syria  and  Iran  with  terrorism 
 and  not  Saddam  regime.  The  US  Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell 
 said  Sunday  that  Syria  would  have  to  be  a  major  choice: 
 "Syria  will  continue  to  direct  support  terrorist  groups  and 
 the  Saddam  regime  is  on  the  verge  of  collapse  or  take  a 
 different  and  more  promising  approach.  In  any  case,  Syria 
 for  its  choices  and  its  consequences.  "  The  Bush  administration 
 yesterday  made  it  clear  that  Rumsfeld  claimed  mainly  in  night-vision 
 care  equipment  from  Syria  to  Iraq,  the  US  side  has  not 
 detected  further  deliveries  of  equipment.

 once  again  to  the  US  Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell's  visit, 
 the  Turkish  government  and  the  military  full  of  hope  and 
 expectation  that  aircraft  could  not  be  lost  if  the  United 
 States  once  again  the  US  military  presence,  Turkey  would 
 definitely  take  into  account,  but  previous  commitments  in 
 the  hope  that  the  United  States  paid  huge  amounts  of  compensation, 
 as  well  as  agreed  with  the  Turkish  military  presence  in 
 northern  Iraq.  At  the  Department  of  State  Colin  Powell  speaking 
 at  a  press  conference  yesterday  in  this  (a)  day  visit  to 
 Belgium  on  the  way  after  visits  to  Turkey  on  Iraq's  war 
 with  the  Turkish  government  high-level  talks,  but  mainly  in 
 northern  Iraq  to  Turkey  on  Kurdish  issues,  and  American-Turkish 
 cooperation  between  the  two  sides  on  this  issue.  According 
 to  the  Turkish  foreign  ministry  officials  said  that  Powell 
 is  scheduled  for  around  11  pm  tonight  arrived  in  Ankara, 
 is  scheduled  for  tomorrow  (2)  left  at  4  pm,  during  his 
 stay,  will  meet  with  Turkish  President  AIDS  Zhai,  prime  minister 
 and  senior  military  officer,  chief  of  staff  Eauze  Cook.  The 
 State  Department  official  said  that  Powell's  visit  to  Ankara 
 had  no  particular  "with  the  intention"  to  the  improvement 
 of  bilateral  relations,  thanks  to  US  warplanes  crossing  Turkish 
 airspace  and  called  on  Turkey  to  agree  to  an  emergency  landing 
 at  US  warplanes  to  bases  in  Turkey,  mainly  in  northern  Iraq 
 reiterated  that  the  United  States  in  the  position  that  against 
 Turkey  into  northern  Iraq  in  order  to  avoid  local  Kurdish 
 conflict,  thereby  affecting  the  US  war  in  Iraq.  But  the 
 Turkish  government,  Powell  to  visit  Iraq  war  war  abroad  visit 
 the  United  States  since  the  first  high-ranking  officials, 
 but  the  Turkish  parliament  on  March  1  to  reject  the  US 
 military  presence  has  resulted  in  poor  relations  between  the 
 two  sides,  has  offered  to  visit  Turkey,  which  must  be  an 
 extraordinary  significance,  and  her  full  of  hope  and  expectation, 
 it  was  imperative  for  Powell  to  visit  the  real  motives. 
 According  to  Ankara  observers  indicated  that  that  Powell's 
 visit  to  northern  Iraq,  in  other  words,  with  the  United 
 States  is  anxious  to  open  in  the  northern  front  Ikita  fundamental 
 relationship  because  the  US  war  in  southern  Iraq  is  not 
 easy,  while  in  the  north  also  lack  heavy  weapons  and  equipment, 
 while  last  week  in  northern  Iraq  a  thousand  elite  airborne 
 troops,  but  was  unable  to  keep  the  Soviet  Moldova  with  al-Caicoo 
 two  oil  center,  the  Iraqi  armed  forces  to  tackle  difficult 
 problems.  The  United  States  planned  at  least  60,000  ground 
 troops  stationed  in  Turkey,  255  F-65  fighter  planes  and  attack 
 helicopters,  as  a  transit  north  Iraq  to  open  a  second  front, 
 in  southern  Iraq  to  meet  Kuwait's  First  Front,  the  north 
 and  south  Iraq  constitutes  an  attack  from  both  sides  battle 
 formation  Shan  Zong  Tonghai  to  shorten  the  war  time  and 
 reduce  casualties.  Turkish  parliament  has  not  been  expected 
 in  March  to  disagree,  the  first  US  military  presence  and 
 forced  the  US  Army  provisional  change  the  war,  have  also 
 contributed  to  the  current  Iraqi  war  into  a  plastic  state. 
 The  White  House  and  the  Pentagon  has  repeatedly  blamed  Turkey 
 is  the  only  refusal  to  cooperate  in  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty 
 Organization  allies,  Turkey  also  abolished  the  previously  agreed 
 to  pay  war  compensation  fund  and  the  US  $26  billion  lending 
 commitments.  Turkey  has  also  upset  endlessly  for  this  purpose. 
 Although  the  March  20,  the  Turkish  parliament  agreed  with 
 the  United  States  warplanes  transit  to  Iraq,  but  later  the 
 time  and  again  in  the  US  cruise  missile  and  crashed  in 
 southeastern  Turkey,  Turkish  government  has  so  far  has  repeatedly 
 declared  that  the  security  in  the  airspace  closure  against 
 US  warplanes  and  missiles  transit  airspace  in  the  United 
 States  against  Iraq  and  to  combat  increased  much  trouble. 
 Nevertheless,  the  ball  between  the  Turkish  initiative  that 
 would  be  expected  to  visit  Turkey,  and  give  up  the  relationship 
 between  the  two  sides  have  breathe  feebly  angry  note  a  unit, 
 at  least  the  two  sides  have  been  stalled  for  a  long  time 
 for  a  moment  of  diplomatic  activity  in  the  intensive  contacts 
 resumption.  Turkish  Prime  Minister,  AIDS,  high-level  meeting 
 yesterday  in  ruling  party  first  said  Powell  could  bring  new 
 demands,  but  no  matter  what,  Turkey  will  be  taken  into  account. 
 AIDS  is  being  called  back,  in  Brussels  of  the  ruling  party 
 membership  of  the  European  Parliament  members  of  parliament, 
 so  as  to  increase  the  number  of  ruling  party  in  parliament 
 to  pass  any  requests  made  by  the  United  States.  Turkish 
 president  Zhai  yesterday  in  the  presidential  palace,  the  new 
 ambassadors  met  with  Russian  history,  the  Thai  ambassadors 
 present  credentials,  journalists  to  visit,  also  said  that 
 the  Turkish  war  against  Iraq  could  be  any  contribution,  if 
 the  United  States,  Turkey  is  willing  to  consider.  But  the 
 United  States  does  not  at  this  stage.  Powell's  visit  to 
 the  Turkish  military  to  stick  to  the  expectations.  The  Turkish 
 military  has  been  in  Turkey  and  Iraq  deployment  of  several 
 thousand  troops  along  the  border  areas  and  at  least  300 
 tanks,  closely  followed  developments  in  northern  Iraq,  in 
 particular  whether  the  northern  Kurdish  northern  Iraq  took 
 the  opportunity  to  seize  two  oil  center:  Morocco  and  Caicoo 
 Sool,  and  whether  the  intention  of  establishing  an  independent 
 state.  Turkey  fears  that  northern  Iraqi  Kurdish  state  in 
 the  territory  may  stimulate  its  own  Kurdish  residents  of 
 20  million  renegade  sentiments.  However,  no  matter  whether 
 it  Kurdish  northern  Iraq  to  seize  oil  stronghold  or  an  independent 
 state  with  the  intention,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  attack 
 Saddam  Kurdish  militia  of  the  United  States  is  strongly  against 
 Turkey  into  northern  Iraq,  on  the  grounds  that  Turkey  into 
 northern  Iraq  is  bound  to  trigger  worries  Kurdish  resistance, 
 thus  causing  bloodshed  conflict  areas,  resulting  in  the  war 
 Iraq  war  and  undermine  the  United  States  enter  and  occupy 
 Iraq's  overall  plan.  Despite  the  fact  that  the  United  States 
 has  repeatedly  promised  not  to  allow  Turkish  Kurdish  militia 
 stronghold  oil  rush  into  northern  Iraq,  there  will  be  Ikita 
 base  in  Germany,  but  the  problem  is  not  to  believe  that 
 Turkey  would  not  usurp  the  Kurds  nor  nation-building  fields. 
 In  other  words,  Turkey  also  do  not  believe  that  the  United 
 States.  According  to  the  Turkish  intelligence  showed  that 
 northern  Iraqi  Kurds  have  chosen  a  post-war  with  al-Caicoo 
 Soviet  presence  in  Moldova,  the  mayor  of  the  city.  Ankara 
 observers  believe  that  that  Powell's  visit  to  Ankara,  Turkish 
 military  will  provide  themselves  with  the  latest  developments 
 in  northern  Iraq  and  asked  the  United  States  to  address 
 the  concerns  of  Turkey,  and  may  require  resumption  of  the 
 earlier  agreement  that  the  United  States  agreed  to  enter 
 Turkey  near  northern  Iraqi  Kurds,  monitor  the  activities  of 
 the  US  might  agree  to  exchange  of  the  Turkish  transit  heavy 
 equipment  to  Iraq.

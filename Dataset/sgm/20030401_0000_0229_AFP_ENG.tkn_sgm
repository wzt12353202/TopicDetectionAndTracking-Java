Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile on Tuesday accused Japan and 
the European Union (EU) of jeopardising moves toward global free trade 
by making the World Trade Organization (WTO) miss a key deadline on 
agricultural reform. Vaile said foot dragging by anti-reformists among 
the 145-member WTO had led to the organisation missing its March 31 
deadline for agreeing on the "modalities" -- or nuts and bolts details 
-- of freeing up farm trade. He warned the WTO's entire global trade 
liberalisation program could now become bogged down. "The responsibility 
for this failure sits squarely at the feet of those members, such 
as the EU and Japan, who are continuing to oppose efforts to bring 
about genuine trade reform of agricultural trade," he said. "It is 
time for some serious political leadership by the EU." Vaile said 
if no progress was made he would call a meeting in Geneva of the pro-reform 
Cairns Group, which has 18 members including Australia, Canada, Indonesia 
and Argentina. He is also likely to lobby developing nations in a 
bid to increase pressure for reform. "We will not sit idly by and 
watch the Europeans work up another no-reform proposal that will preserve 
agricultural protection for decades to come," Vaile said. The Cairns 
Group has proposed farm tariffs in developed countries be cut to a 
maximum of 25 percent but the EU and Japan advocate a slower approach, 
taking into account the role of farming in issues such as environmental 
protection and food security. Vaile has previously cited Japan's rice 
tariff of 778 percent and the EU sugar tariff of 228 percent as examples 
of unacceptable practices. Most recently, he condemned Japan's decision 
last week to hike tariffs on Australian beef imports from 38.5 percent 
to 50 percent from August. Agriculture has proved a crucial stumbling 
block in the implementation of the WTO's so-called Doha round of trade 
reform, which is due to be completed by the end of 2004. The Doha 
talks also cover other trade areas including services and industrial 
tariffs such as anti-dumping measures. Opposition trade spokesman 
Craig Emerson said the WTO strategy for global tariff reform was being 
undermined by a succession of bilateral free trade agreements, such 
as the one currently being negotiated between Australia and the United 
States. Emerson likened the WTO's problem to that faced by the United 
Nations over Iraq, where coalition partners acted against Iraq without 
waiting for approval from the UN. "The world is living dangerously, 
with multilateral institutions being undermined by bilateral and regional 
efforts," he said. ns/dv WTO-trade-agriculture-Australia

Eight communist guerrillas have been killed in a clash north of the 
Philippine capital, the military said Tuesday. Soldiers, investigating 
a tip-off from residents, encountered members of the communist New 
People's Army (NPA) in Dipaculao town, Aurora province, 150 kilometers 
(93 miles) northeast of Manila on Monday, a military spokesman said. 
Local residents said they saw the rebels dragging away the bodies 
of eight of their slain comrades after the fighting. Troops recovered 
four rifles, eight knapsacks and other supplies from the fallen rebels. 
The NPA is the armed wing of the underground Communist Party of the 
Philippines, tagged a terrorist group by the United States. The NPA 
marked their 34th founding anniversary last Saturday with a call for 
all guerrillas to step up offensives around the Philippines. On Sunday, 
at least 20 NPA guerrillas were killed in a gunbattle with the police 
and military in Bulacan province north of Manila. str/mm/jvg/mfc Philippines-communist

Vietnam's human rights record for 2002 received poor marks from the 
US State Department, which in a report Monday detailed violence by 
security forces and continuing persecution of the country's ethnic 
minorities. According to the 2002 annual US State Department report 
on human rights world-wide, the Vietnamese government "continued to 
commit serious abuses." "Police sometimes beat suspects during arrests, 
detention, and interrogation. Several sources also reported that security 
forces detained, beat, and were responsible for the disappearances 
of numerous persons during the year. There were reports of killings 
by authorities," the report stated. In January, local newspapers reported 
that a man suspected of attacking the home of a village police chief 
with a grenade was tortured to death while in police custody, the 
report said. Two police officers were awaiting trial for the man's 
death, according to the report, but Vietnamese authorities were not 
immediately available to comment. The State Department also accused 
the Vietnamese government of continuing to deprive ethnic minorities 
of civil and religious freedoms following massive protests in the 
country's Central Highlands in early 2001. "Since 2001 the military 
has played a large role in the Central Highlands by enforcing restrictions 
on gatherings, by detaining individuals, and by enforcing travel restrictions," 
the report said. Based on recent investigations by human rights organizations, 
the State Department believed, "Hmong Protestant Christians in several 
northwestern villages and various ethnic minority Protestant Christians 
in the Central Highlands were pressured or forced to recant their 
faith." The report also said that despite some loosening of controls 
on the press, "The freedom to criticize the Communist Party and its 
highest leadership remained restricted." dla/sdm/mfc Vietnam-US-droits

The Philadelphia 76ers finally figured out how to guard Tracy McGrady. 
The 76ers harassed McGrady late in the fourth quarter and overtime 
while getting big games from Allen Iverson and Kenny Thomas as they 
clinched their sixth straight playoff berth with a 118-113 victory 
over the Orlando Magic. Iverson scored a season-high 42 points, including 
two huge baskets in overtime. He has 46 career 40-point games and 
the 76ers have won the last 12. Thomas continued his stellar play 
with 24 points and a season-high 20 rebounds, 12 on the offensive 
end. But the key to Philadelphia's fourth straight road win was its 
defence on McGrady, who has supplanted Iverson as the NBA's leading 
scorer. Over the last seven minutes, the Sixers limited McGrady to 
one basket and one free throw as they repeatedly chased the ball out 
of his hands. gph03 Basket-NBA-Iverson

South Korea posted a trade deficit for the third straight month in 
March due to higher oil import costs amid the war in Iraq, government 
statistics showed Tuesday. The Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry 
said the country's customs-cleared trade account was 362 million dollars 
in the red last month, compared with 1.26 billion dollars in black 
a year ago. The trade account for the first three months to March 
showed a 840 million dollar accumulated deficit with the shortfalls 
of 375 million dollars of February and 102 million dollars of January, 
it added. The ministry attributed the trade deficits largely to rising 
oil prices which had been already volatile even before the ongoing 
US-led war in Iraq. "The trade account has recorded three straight 
months of shortfalls as imports are growing at a faster rate on higher 
oil prices," it said. "But it could turn to a surplus again should 
oil prices fall to below 30 dollars, even if the US-led war against 
Iraq is prolonged." In March, exports rose 17.5 percent year-on-year 
to 15.57 billion dollars while imports jumped 32.9 percent year-on-year 
to 27.75 billion dollars. Ministry statistics showed the country's 
spending for oil imports stood at 2.45 billion dollars in March, up 
66 percent from a year ago. In March, handset and automobile exports 
were brisk, while semiconductors and computer shipments dropped on 
a weaker IT industry, they showed. Semiconductor exports dropped for 
the first time in 12 months due to falls in memory chip prices to 
1.33 billion dollars in March, down 7.3 percent from a year earlier.

Indonesian Satellite Corp (Indosat) has reported a fall in net profit 
last year of nearly 70 percent to 336.25 billion rupiah (37.8 million 
dollars) but its president said the fundamentals remained strong. 
The profit, reported late Monday by the international call operator, 
fell due to goodwill amortisation, provisions for doubtful debts and 
tax charges. The company booked sales of 6.77 trillion rupiah last 
year, up from 5.138 trillion in 2001, while operating profit increased 
to 1.911 trillion from 1.828 trillion. Indosat president Widya Purnama 
told financial newswire AFX-Asia the net profit fall was basically 
driven by non-operating items arising from the restructuring in the 
telecommunications sector. Purnama referred to the termination of 
the cross-ownership deal between Indosat and PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia 
(Telkom) in a number of subsidiaries which among other things resulted 
in Indosat's acquisition of Telkom's stake in mobile phone unit Satelindo. 
"This net profit fall does not really matter to me because our fundamentals 
remain strong," he said. Purnama said Indosat would continue to rely 
on the cellular business as the major revenue contributor but would 
also try to contain the decline in international direct dialling revenue. 
Separately domestic call operator Telkom late Monday reported a near 
doubling in net profit to 8.35 trillion rupiah in 2002 on the back 
of stronger operating income and gains from sale of investments. The 
company booked an operating profit of 9.40 trillion rupiah, up from 
7.62 trillion in 2001, on sales of 21.40 trillion against 15.13 trillion.

Livestock in southern China may be the source of the mysterious virus 
that has killed more than 60 people and caused a global health scare, 
sources close to the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Tuesday. 
"WHO is working on a theory that the virus has its source in farm 
animals in southern China," a source from the Geneva-based body told 
AFP in Manila. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which 
erupted in southern China's Guangdong province has spread to Hong 
Kong and taken worldwide in an unprecedented fashion by airline passengers. 
"In some areas in Guangdong province in southern China, people just 
live neck to jaw with animals -- pigs, chickens, ducks are everywhere," 
the source said. Scientists have already ruled out a link between 
SARS and bird flu, also a viral disease highly contagious to chickens, 
ducks, turkeys and other birds but not dangerous to other animals 
and humans. Asked to confirm the links between SARS and farm animals 
in southern China, Peter Cordingley, the spokesman for the Manila-based 
Western Pacific WHO regional office, said: "At this stage, we are 
not saying this is the cause but is certainly something we are looking 
into in the general scheme of things." Cordingley said the WHO was 
still awaiting authorisation from the Chinese authorities to pay a 
visit to Guangdong province, where the SARS outbreak occurred way 
back in November. China has come under fire from various quarters 
for providing little information about the epidemic south of the world's 
most populous nation where 34 people have died so far, according to 
Chinese authorities. The mysterious illness has now infected some 
1,700 people in 15 countries and killed at least 62 people. pp/jvg/pch

Australian military leaders backed up US claims Tuesday that the war 
in Iraq is progressing successfully and according to schedule despite 
what were described as a number of surprises. Defence force chief, 
General Peter Cosgrove, said carefully prepared plans for the war 
had always recognised the nature and size of the operation, in which 
2,000 Australians are the third force in the US-led coalition. "It's 
clear from were I stand that, notwithstanding some of the unexpected 
and unusual events that have occurred, the war is right on its timeline 
and well within the success parameters that the plan envisaged," he 
told reporters. "After less than two weeks large sections of Iraq 
are under coalition control and the Iraqi army has been severely weakened. 
The regime has been hit precisely and hard. "The south of the country 
will be progressively secured and cleared of Iraqi forces of all types 
over the coming days and weeks." This, he said, would allow further 
humanitarian relief to flow and the liberation of the Iraqi people 
to begin, "setting the stage for the decisive defeat of a regime that 
harbours weapons of mass destruction." Cosgrove, a popular and trusted 
figure in Australia after leading its successful military intervention 
in East Timor in 1999, said the media had helped obscure what he called 
"the bigger picture". While correspondents had given the public an 
unprecedented view of the war, their inevitable focus had been on 
detail -- "a skirmish here and a battle there". "My view is that the 
bigger picture is one of dramatic success and a plan on time in achieving 
the goals it set for itself," he said. He also admitted to being disappointed 
but not surprised that weapons of mass destruction had not been found 
so far, but said this meant only that further work had to be done 
to find them. But he said the possibility of rapid success had never 
been the basis of the plan to defeat Iraq. "War is full of surprises, 
this conflict has had a few already and there are probably more ahead 
-- that is just the nature of a battle. Cosgrove said there had been 
a few minor surprises such as the use of human shields and the fact 
that Iraqi troops had been wearing civilian clothes, mingling with 
civilians and firing on coalition forces. "That is a terrorist act 
under any definition," he said. "I think even people inured to 12 
years of close study of Saddam Hussein and years of longer range experience 
of his actions...could not understand how he would brutalise his own 
population in trying to cling to a presidential seat in a presidential 
palace somewhere in Baghdad or Tikrit." He said the war had so far 
been a great success for a force that was relatively small compared 
to the 1991 Gulf war coalition, and it had achieved its successes 
with a concern to avoid civilian casualties and damage that was unique 
in war. The southern oilfields were secure, there had been no ballistic 
missile attacks on Israel, the situation in northern Iraq was much 
more stable than had been feared and the more pessimistic predictions 
had not eventuated. jt/mfc Iraq-war-Australia

The dollar rose against the yen Tuesday on possible dollar-buying 
intervention by Tokyo while investors all but ignored data showing 
worsening Japanese business confidence, dealers said. The greenback 
was quoted at 118.24 yen around 1:30 pm (0430 GMT), up from 118.15 
yen in New York late Monday. Earlier the US unit dropped to a low 
of 117.78 yen in Tokyo due to rising concern over a protracted US-led 
war against Iraq. "Investors did not take the Tankan results as a 
lead in the market. They were more concerned about the possibility 
of a long war in Iraq and its impact on the US economy," said Masato 
Imai, dealer at UFJ Holdings. The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey showed 
business confidence among large manufacturers declined to minus 10 
in the three months to March from minus nine in the previous quarter, 
and sentiment among large non-manufacturers improved slightly to minus 
14 from minus 16. The dollar later climbed from the 117-yen level 
as investors speculated the BoJ, under the direction of the finance 
ministry, intervened in the market to prop up the dollar. "A major 
trust bank was buying lots of dollars. Maybe this could be dollar-buying 
intervention" on behalf of the Japanese authorities, Imai said. Finance 
Minister Masajuro Shiokawa suggested earlier Tuesday that Tokyo would 
intervene to halt severe fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. 
"If we see rapid movements in the market, we will intervene," Shiokawa 
told reporters. But gains in the dollar were limited due to growing 
worry over the duration of the war. "Investors were concerned that 
a prolonged war could start hurting US economic fundamentals," said 
Hideyuki Tsukamoto, dealer at Mizuho Bank. The euro was firmer, buying 
1.0910 dollars at about 1:30 pm, against 1.0902 dollars in New York 
Monday afternoon. Against the yen, the euro traded at 129.10, compared 
with 128.81 in New York. Barclays Capital in Singapore said developments 
in the Iraqi battlefield at the weekend still weighed on the dollar 
as they "did nothing to shake the market's growing perception that 
the war may be of far longer duration and intensity than was previously 
assumed." Soft economic data from the US also added to the bearish 
picture for the dollar, it said. In early afternoon trade in Singapore, 
the dollar rose to 1.7668 Singapore dollars from 1.7645 the previous 
day and 8,905 Indonesian rupiah from 8,902. The greenback fell to 
53.35 Philippine peso from 53.57, 34.7579 Taiwan dollars from 34.7645 
and 1,253.45 South Korean won from 1,259.05. It was unchanged at 42.865 
Thai baht. shi-bur/ja/dv Forex-Asia

A British soldier has died while on duty in southern Iraq, taking 
to 26 the British death toll since the start of the war on Iraq 13 
days ago, the defence ministry announced on Tuesday. The soldier died 
on Monday "in the course of his duties", a ministry spokesman told 
AFP. He declined to give details of where the soldier died or what 
unit he belonged to, explaining that the man's family had still to 
be informed. But he said it was "very unlikely" that the soldier had 
been killed by friendly fire. Twenty five other British soldiers have 
been killed since the beginning of the war nearly two weeks ago, 15 
of them in accidents. Five have been killed by friendly fire and five 
have died in combat. ib/gil/tm Iraq-war-Britain-casualties

His pull-up jumper touched nothing but net, and Allen Iverson froze, 
pointing a finger toward Monty Williams, who leapt off the bench as 
the Orlando Magic called a time-out. This was a slugfest, and late 
in the fight, Iverson delivered a potent blow that eventually won 
the game for the 76ers Monday. The final score: Sixers 118, Magic 
113, appropriately enough in overtime. It was a tough, tight, fun 
and frenetic game from tip-off to final buzzer, a bruiser between 
two teams who, if the Magic hold up, will be playing when the postseason 
begins in a few weeks. For the Sixers, the win was as impressive as 
any they had during a wild month that ended where it started - on 
the road, in front of a hostile crowd. The Sixers ended March with 
their 11th win in 16 attempts, their ninth in 12 road games, and they 
officially own a playoff berth. "Good," Iverson said when told of 
his team's achievement. "It's just a good feeling we're in. The East's 
so crazy." So was this game. After a frenzied three quarters, the 
Sixers trailed Orlando, 107-97, with three minutes, 31 seconds to 
go. But suddenly, despite being unable to stop him all game, the Sixers 
quieted Tracy McGrady, who began missing shots and committing turnovers. 
With a 13-3 run, the Sixers pulled even with Orlando, 110-110, with 
32.9 seconds remaining. That score stood at the buzzer, and the Sixers 
set the tone for overtime when Kenny Thomas dunked an Iverson miss 
on the first play. "It's a huge win for us," coach Larry Brown said. 
"It caps off an unbelievable month." All night, it was the Iverson-McGrady 
show, with each player trying to one-up the other. But when McGrady 
stared down the Sixers' bench after a fourth-quarter turnaround jumper, 
the heat was on. While the Magic managed only three points in overtime, 
the Sixers scored eight, and Iverson delivered four of them. In 50 
minutes of action, he finished with a game-high 42 points, six assists 
and six rebounds. For the 13th consecutive game, McGrady scored at 
least 30 points. He missed 20 shots but fell one assist shy of a triple-double 
with 39 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists. "They're two of the best 
players I've ever seen play out there," Brown said. "Allen and Tracy, 
they ought to bottle those two." The Sixers could bottle whatever 
propelled them through March. The travel was brutal, the crowds hostile, 
and the time at home scarce. But they bonded on the road, and Thomas 
has emerged playing better than anyone except Iverson. Monday, he 
recorded his fifth double-double in the last six games. His statistics 
were so gaudy that Iverson was dismayed when, in the locker room, 
Eric Snow pointed them out. Thomas had 24 points and 20 rebounds, 
becoming the first Sixer since Dikembe Mutombo in January 2002 to 
grab 20 rebounds. "I've never been to the playoffs," said Thomas, 
who spent his first few seasons with the Houston Rockets. "So every 
chance I get to step on the floor, I'm going to help my team win." 
The Sixers won for just the sixth time in 28 games at the TD Waterhouse 
Center, and evened their four-game season series with the Magic. gph03

North Korea test fired another anti-ship missile on Tuesday, a Japan 
Defense Agency spokesman said. "A missile was launched today at around 
10:15 am (0115 GMT)," the spokesman said. "But we don't know any more 
details." Land, Infrastructure and Transport minister Chikage Ogi 
announced the missile launch at the end of a parliamentary committee 
session, a transport ministry spokesman said. "I just received a preliminary 
report that North Korea seems to have fired a surface-to-vessel missile 
at 10:15 am, that the launch site was Hwajinri in Pyongannamdo (province) 
on the opposite side (of the Korean Peninsula) from the previous launch 
site and that its range was 60 kilometres (38 miles) like the previous 
time," the spokesman quoted Ogi as saying. Only one missile was launched, 
and it was thought likely to have been a Chinese-made Silkworm missile, 
Jiji quoted government sources as saying. South Korea's defense ministry 
said it was still checking the reports while Seoul's stock market 
took the launch in its stride, holding steady following the reports. 
North Korea test-fired short-range anti-ship missiles on February 
24 and March 10. Speculation has been rife in the Japanese media that 
North Korea would test fire another missile around the time of Japan's 
placing into orbit last Friday of its first spy satellites, a move 
denounced by Pyongyang as a "hostile act" that could spark a new arms 
race. burs-ja/mfc NKorea-nuclear-missile-Japan

Fear and confusion over a killer virus which has left more than 60 
people dead and 1,700 infected worldwide are boosting sales of traditional 
medicine and vitamins in East Asia. Doctors and Chinese medicine practitioners 
warn that herbal remedies and Vitamin C will not provide a guarantee 
against catching Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), but the 
cash registers keep ringing. The virus causing SARS, a mystery respiratory 
illness which first erupted in southern China and has been transported 
to North America and Europe by travellers, has yet to be identified 
by scientists. In the meantime, Asians are fortifying themselves with 
self-prescribed remedies and wearing medical masks to avoid catching 
the virus. Freddie Lim of TCM Chinese Medicines in Singapore, which 
sells "strengthening teas" to worried families, said his concoction 
"will strengthen your immune system, but it won't cure SARS." Singapore 
is a predominantly ethnic Chinese city state where four people have 
died and 92 infected by SARS. Schools have been shut down in a bid 
to contain the spread of the disease. Chinese believe "body heat" 
can cause flu, so one must take "cooling" concoctions to expel this 
from the system. Chen Keng Leong, another traditional Chinese medicine 
practitioner in Singapore, sells family packs as well as individual 
servings of herbal teas "but again we want people to know that there 
are no guarantees." "Traditional medicine encourages long-term health 
care solutions, and not short term quick-fixes," he said. In Taipei, 
Huang Yu-han, a doctor from the Chinese Medicine Department of Linkou 
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, said he had advised his patients to 
boost their immune systems. "Chinese herbal medicines are not supposed 
to kill viruses but to help the patients diagnosed as showing the 
symptoms of 'hsu,' or physical weakness," he said. Li Ying-sang, chairman 
of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Merchants Association, said orders for 
herbal medicines have more than doubled in the past two weeks. Some 
consumers even come with their own prescriptions. "Chinese herbal 
medicine is widely believed to have preventive properties, and is 
mainly used to build up body resistance," he said. In the past week, 
leading Chinese-language newspapers in Hong Kong have published several 
prescriptions, while others offered recipes for medicinal soups to 
strengthen the lungs, such as chestnut brewed with lean pork along 
with dried tamarind skin and dried sweet plum. Others prescribed chrysanthemum 
and honey to expel body toxins and heat. In Beijing, residents are 
stocking up on Banlangen, a traditional Chinese medicine believed 
to be effective in preventing flu. Jiao Lifang, a Beijing-based staff 
member at Tongrentang, a chain store for traditional Chinese medicine, 
said daily sales of Banlangen have increased five to 10 times as a 
result of the health scare. Mainstream pharmacies and healthcare stores 
are also experiencing an increase in sales of Vitamin C, which has 
long been regarded as an immunity booster against colds and flu. Andrew 
Chng, a 31-year-old Singaporean engineer, bought some Vitamin C after 
being affected by all the news about SARS. "Me and my girlfiend decided 
to be safe than sorry," he said. A family doctor in Singapore said 
"my advice to patients is to eat properly, drink lots of water, take 
plenty of fruits, get enough sleep and avoid crowded places." "These 
are the normal sensible things to do to stay healthy," he said. "Not 
everybody who comes into contact with SARS becomes infected. If your 
immunity is stronger, then you're less likely to catch the infection, 
and even if you catch the infection, you are able to fight the infection."

Despite being a staunch US ally in Asia, Japan got a tongue lashing 
for prisoner abuse and human trafficking in a human rights report 
released by the US government Monday. Prisons' use of leather restraining 
devices, which resulted in the death by abdominal injuries of a 49-year-old 
inmate in May 2002, received prominent treatment in the 16-page section 
on Japan's human rights situation compiled by the US State Department. 
The report appeared to be written before Japan's Justice Ministry 
decided in March it would ban the punitive restraints, effective from 
September. "There continued to be credible reports that police and 
prison officials physically and psychologically abused prisoners and 
detainees," the report said. "Officials sometimes were dismissed for 
such abuse but were seldom tried, convicted, and imprisoned," it said. 
In December three prison warders were indicted for the death, along 
with five arrests in a separate incident, the report noted. "Physical 
restraints, such as leather belts with attached leather manacles, 
continued to be used as a form of punishment, and some prisoners were 
forced to eat and relieve themselves unassisted while wearing these 
restraints," it said. The State Department also pointed out that "violence 
against women and children, child prostitution, and trafficking in 
women were problems." It noted the lack of protection for women brought 
to Japan to work as prostitutes, mostly from Thailand, the Philippines 
and former Soviet Union, adding that government figures "may understate" 
the extent of the problem. Few have ever been prosecuted for trafficking, 
and as for the victims brought to the attention of authorities, "generally 
they were deported as illegal aliens," the report said. rn/ja/sdm/mfc

Philippine share prices closed 0.15 percent lower on Tuesday, pressured 
by the downturn on foreign markets, dealers said. The Philippine Stock 
Exchange composite index fell 1.60 points to 1,038.07. "We have a 
negative backdrop externally, with the market moving in conjunction 
with other markets such as the United States and some of the major 
regional markets," said Andrew Long of ATR Kim Eng Securities. Concerns 
over the possibility of a protracted war in Iraq "continue to affect 
everybody," causing oil prices to remain high, Long added. Volume 
rose to 267.67 million shares but value fell to 113.09 million pesos 
(2.11 million dollars) from 190.1 million shares worth 179.2 million 
pesos on Monday. San Miguel Corp. saw both its A and B shares unchanged 
at 58 and 67.50 pesos respectively. Philippine Long Distance Telephone 
Co. was also unchanged at 315 pesos. SM Prime Holdings dropped five 
centavos to 4.95 pesos. The Manila Electric Co. saw its B shares drop

North Korea on Tuesday accused the United States of abusing the religious 
and human rights of Islamic nations by waging war in Iraq and Afghanistan 
after Washington branded the Stalinist state a serial human rights 
abuser. Washington's human rights abuse charges were "fictions" brought 
as pretexts by the United States in its goal of launching military 
action against North Korea, the official Korean Central News Agency 
(KCNA) said. "Such crafty trick can never be tolerated," the agency 
said. "The people of the DPRK (North Korea) are single-heartedly united 
as a big harmonious family because religious freedom and human rights 
are fully guaranteed by law." KCNA said the United States was in no 
position to criticize other nations on human rights. "The US human 
rights abuses are clearly evidenced by its war moves for carrying 
out its strategy to dominate the world. Its wars against Islamic Afghanistan 
and Iraq are a clear proof of its typical religious and human rights 
abuses," KCNA said. "The US, which is killing innocent people after 
violating the sovereignty of Iraq, is faulting other countries, behaving 
as if it were a human rights judge. How brazen-faced and ridiculous 
it is." KCNA said a resolution passed in the US Congress that "groundlessly" 
denounced suppression of religious freedom and other human rights 
abuses in North Korea was referred to the UN Commission on Human Rights 
now sitting in Geneva. "The DPRK strongly protests against these actions," 
KCNA said. The protest came a day after the US State Department criticised 
North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il's regime for using torture, forced 
abortion and capital punishment as instruments of state power. In 
its annual human rights report, the State Department painted an appalling 
picture of life in North Korea. The report came as the United States 
is locked in a showdown with North Korea over the isolated country's 
plans to develop nuclear weapons. "The government's human rights record 
remained poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses," 
the State Department report said. "Citizens did not have the right 
peacefully to change their government, and the leadership viewed most 
international human rights norms, particularly individual rights, 
as illegitimate, alien, and subversive to the goals of the state and 
party," it added. cw/jkw/sdm/mfc NKorea-rights-US

AS-SALIYAH, Qatar, April 1 (AFP) - US marines have seized a huge Iraqi 
ammunition supply depot in south-central Iraq, an officer said in 
a statement released here Tuesday at the US military's forward command 
center. "We continue to press the attack against the enemy, conducting 
spoiling raids while eliminating Saddam's ability to support his death 
squads and their mistreatment of the Iraqi people," said Colonel Bennett 
W. Saylor, 1st Marine Division chief of staff. The raid was carried 
out Sunday on the 11th day of a US-led invasion aimed at toppling 
President Saddam Hussein. The marines found large stocks of ammunition, 
rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and other weapons, the 
statement said. Marine Corps demolitions and ordnance experts were 
called to the scene, the precise location of which was not disclosed, 
to evaluate means to dispose of the weapons and ammunition. No marines 
or civilians were reported injured during the seizure of the depot, 
according to the US military. nh/kir Iraq-war-US-marines-depot

The United States praised Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi 
on Monday and castigated her bitter enemies in the country's junta, 
in a withering analysis of the country's human rights situation. "Even 
after years of on-and-off political arrest, harassment and constant 
surveillance, Aung San Suu Kyi is still wholly committed to bringing 
democracy and a humane rule of law to the Burmese people," the State 
Department said in its annual human rights report. "Her tremendous 
strength of character stands boldly in the face of the military regime's 
disregard for human rights and democracy, a disregard that extends 
to abuses such as extrajudicial killings, rapes, disappearances, forced 
labor and forced relocations." The United States engages in frequent 
rhetorical battles with the junta, and is a strong supporter of Aung 
San Suu Kyi, maintaining an array of investment strategies to protest 
her exclusion from politics. It said that 1,300 political prisoners 
remained behind bars, in conditions which were often harsh and life-threatening. 
Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate, was released from house 
arrest in May 2002 and has been engaged in UN-brokered talks with 
the junta since October 2000, but they are yet to progress beyond 
a confidence-building stage. US officials have made no secret at their 
disappointment that the consultations have made little progress so 
far. The report, part of the broader Country Reports on Human Rights 
Practices covering 196 nations, slammed the ruling State Peace and 
Development Council (SPDC) for its "extremely poor" rights peformance 
in 2002. "The regime's human rights record remained extremely poor, 
and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses," the report said. 
It resuscitated allegations that Myanmar troops had raped women from 
ethnic minorities, especially in Shan, Karenni and Karen states, which 
drew international condemnation and fierce denials from the junta 
last year. The ruling junta's security forces, it said, "continued 
to commit extrajudicial killings and rape, forcibly relocated persons, 
used forced labor, and conscripted child soldiers." "Disappearances 
continued, and members of the security forces tortured, beat and otherwise 
abused prisoners and detainees." It also said the SPDC continued to 
restrict freedom of speech, press, assembly, association and religion, 
and that people suspected of pro-democratic activity were subjected 
to surveillance and harassment. It noted how Aung San Suu Kyi's National 
League for Democracy was allowed to open 90 of some 300 offices nationwide 
last year, but said the SPDC did not allow domestic human rights organizations 
to function independently and remained hostile to outside scrutiny 
of its human rights record. Myanmar, the former Burma, has been ruled 
by authoritarian military regimes since 1962. col/mlm/sdm/mfc US-rights-Myanmar

Myanmar's health ministry said Tuesday it was conducting increased 
passenger screenings and other monitoring in efforts to combat the 
threat of a mysterious atypical pneumonia circling the globe. "We 
have been carefully monitoring passengers coming in at the airports 
with medical teams headed by specialists of infectious diseases," 
a senior health ministry official told AFP. The teams have been deployed 
at Yangon's international airport as well as at other airports, sea 
ports and checkpoints particularly along the Chinese and Thai borders, 
the official said. "We have taken all necessary measures to monitor 
the disease, and so far we have not found any suspected cases" of 
the disease labelled as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). 
The deaths of at least 62 people have been attributed to the malady, 
which has sown worldwide fear with more than 1,700 people diagnosed 
with SARS in 15 countries around the globe. Myanmar has issued several 
public alerts about the respiratory illness over the past few weeks 
in its tightly controlled media, and advised anyone exhibiting symptoms 
such as fever, muscular aches, headache and a sore throat to report 
to hospital immediately. Tour companies have reported a decrease in 
business in the past month -- some saying it has dropped off by as 
much as 10 percent -- but have attributed the decline to concerns 
over war in Iraq rather than SARS. Air China officials in Yangon said 
the airline's two flights per week from the Myanmar capital to Beijing 
via the southern China city of Kunming were operating on schedule. 
Myanmar Airways International said its three weekly flights to Singapore 
were also unchanged. mlm/sb/mfc Health-pneumonia-Myanmar

AS-SALIYAH, Qatar, April 1 (AFP) - US troops, fearful of a fresh suicide 
attack, opened fire on a civilian vehicle at a military checkpoint 
in Iraq, killing seven women and children, a US military spokesman 
said here Tuesday. The shooting occurred at a checkpoint manned by 
soldiers from the US Army's Third Infantry Division at Najaf, 150 
kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad, on Monday afternoon, Navy 
Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said. He said the victims, women 
and children, were in a vehicle that failed to stop despite repeated 
warning shots fired by US troops. Four people in the vehicle escaped 
unharmed. "As a last resort, they (US troops) fired into the passenger 
compartment of the vehicle," Owens said at US Central Command's forward 
planning base here. "When soldiers opened the vehicle, they found 
13 women and children inside. Seven of the occupants were dead, two 
were wounded and four were unharmed." As civilian casualties mount 
in Baghdad, where US and British forces are carrying out day and night 
air strikes, the checkpoint shooting was seen as dealing a further 
blow to US efforts to win the affection of the Iraqi people. "On the 
hearts and minds front, the war is still not going particularly well 
for the coalition," said Alan Dupont of the Strategic and Defense 
Studies Center at the Australian National University. Australia has 
committed 2,000 troops to the US-led invasion of Iraq aimed at ousting 
President Saddam Hussein. "That point was illustrated by the unfortunate 
deaths of a number of women and children who were killed when their 
vehicle failed to stop in the early hours of this morning. "That, 
of course, is a public relations disaster for the coalition and does 
illustrate the dilemma they face in conducting this war. "While militarily 
they appear to be regaining the initiative, they've still got a lot 
of ground to make up on the public relations psychological warfare 
front." The US spokesman said an investigation had been opened into 
the shooting. He said the vehicle had approached the checkpoint on 
Route 9 in Najaf and was motioned to stop by US troops. When it kept 
going a warning shot was fired, which failed to halt its progress, 
after which soldiers fired into the engine. When that too had no effect, 
troops opened fire on the passenger compartment, Owens said. A written 
statement issued by Cental Command later said "initial reports indicate 
the soldiers responded in accordance with the rules of engagement 
to protect themselves. "In light of recent terrorist attacks by the 
Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint to avoid 
the unnecessary loss of life." The shooting came as US forces in Iraq 
were on an increased state of alert following a suicide car bombing, 
also near Najaf, on Saturday that killed four US soldiers. On Monday, 
a senior US commander, Brigadier General Vincent Brooks, told reporters 
here that US troops were displaying a "heightened awareness" in their 
encounters with Iraqi civilians as they tried to determine "whether 
a threat is posed or not". "In some cases there may be a threat and 
a non-threat in the same action coming toward you. It's very, very 
difficult to sort that out." nh/kir Iraq-war-US-checkpoint

Iran may have condemned the war raging just over the border in Iraq, 
but it is nevertheless hoping that the US-led coalition forces will 
knock out the leading Iranian armed opposition group, the People's 
Mujahedeen. "The Mujahedeen are a terrorist group," Iranian Foreign 
Minister Kamal Kharazi said Sunday in a rare public sign of what Iran 
hopes to gain out of the war on Iraq. "No government that would have 
the support of the Iraqi people after the fall of Saddam Hussein will 
allow this group to remain active in Iraq," he said. The People's 
Mujahedeen, based on Marxist and Shiite principals, was instrumental 
in the overthrow of the Shah of Iran in 1979 but was later forced 
out of the country by the Islamic regime and set up camp in Iraq, 
where it boasted several bases and thousands of fighting men. Iranian 
opposition groups, both Kurd and Shiite, are hostile to the group, 
which has allied itself to Saddam since the mid-1980s and is classified 
as a terrorist organisation by Iran, the United States and the European 
Union. The People's Mujahedeen has been blamed for numerous assassinations 
and attacks in Iran. During the 1980-1988 war between Iraq and Iran, 
which claimed the lives of around a million people, the Iraqi authorities 
recognised the Mujahedeen as the legitimate representatives of Iran. 
The Iranian authorites are now hoping that the United States, which 
Tehran has often referred to as the "Great Satan" and which in turn 
has placed Iran in its "axis of evil", will soon put the Mujahedeen 
out of action. Both countries regard the group as terrorists. The 
fate of the People's Mujahedeen "is closely linked to that of Saddam 
Hussein," Iran's Intelligence Minister Ali Yunessi said before the 
start of the current war in Iraq. Last week he accused them of "cosying 
up to the Americans by making them think they're on their side, and 
at the same time trying to make Saddam Hussein believe there is a 
danger from Iran." Some diplomats here say that Tehran was given assurances 
that if Iran did not get involved in the war in Iraq that the Mujahedeen 
would be sidelined in whatever regime takes over when Saddam is gone. 
But other diplomats doubt that the United States would make such a 
deal, and point out that the Mujahedeen would be targeted anyhow simply 
because they were allies of Saddam. Foreign Minister Kharazi said 
Sunday that "the policy of the coalition is not to allow the Mujahedeen 
to have a base in Iraq after the fall of Saddam". But he insisted 
that this "does not mean that we have negotiated with the coalition 
on the issue of the the Mujahedeen". Many of the Mujahedeen are reported 
to have defected to save their skins. Intelligence Minister Yunessi 
last week called on them to "abandon your movement's terrorist leaders 
and return to Iran", adding that the "Islamic Republic will forive 
those who repent". But the Mujahedeen leaders will get no such tolerance. 
"The fate of those who cooperated closely with Saddam ... will certainly 
be the same as his," Interior Minister Abdolvahed Moussavi-Lari has 
warned. lal/rm/ps Iraq-war-Iran-Mujahadeen

A man with two hand grenades is holding an airliner with 46 passengers 
hostage at Havana's international airport, demanding that he be flown 
to Miami, officials said. The Soviet-made AN-24 airliner was en route 
from Nueva Gerona to Havana when the hijacker ordered the crew to 
head for Miami but had to land at Jose Marti International Airport 
because it had insufficient fuel, officials said in a statement. The 
airliner is currently parked on the tarmac as authorities "do their 
utmost to seek a solution that ensures the safety and lives of the 
passengers," the statement added. The plane was hijacked at around 
9:30 pm (0130 GMT Tuesday) after taking off from Nueva Gerona, on 
the Island of Youth some 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of the capital, 
the statement said. It was the second hijacking in Cuba in less than 
a month. On March 9 another Cuban airliner also flying out of the 
Island of Youth was hijacked by six men with knives and told to fly 
to Florida. The plane was forced to land by US warplanes in Key West, 
one of Florida's southernmost island. fgf/jlp Cuba-plane

Indonesia Tuesday announced increased measures to prevent the entry 
of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) into the country, including 
tighter checks on incoming travellers. Health minister Achmad Suyudi 
and senior officials attended a meeting at the office of top welfare 
minister Yusuf Kalla on ways to guard against the potentially deadly 
infection. Indonesia has no known SARS cases despite its proximity 
to Singapore, which has 92 reported cases including four deaths. "We 
have, in coordination with the health ministry, stepped up surveillance 
of passengers arriving from overseas, especially from countries where 
SARS has developed, at all main ports of entry, air or sea," said 
an immigration department spokesman, Ade Endang Dahlan. He said immigration 
staff are wearing masks and incoming passengers must fill in a health 
form. Staff are watching arriving passengers for symptoms. "Any suspicious 
cases will be set apart by quarantine officials and if they are ascertained 
to be carrying the disease, we will deport them to their country of 
departure as the law stipulates," he said. So far there has been no 
report of such cases, he said. The number of ferry passengers between 
Indonesia's Batam island and nearby Singapore has fallen by some 40 
percent, the state Antara news agency said. The health ministry said 
no cases of SARS have been detected in Indonesia. It has opened special 
phone lines for inquiries and briefed hospitals across the country 
on the disease. A 17-year-old Indonesian student in Singapore has 
contracted SARS after visiting Guangdong and Hong Kong with his brother 
and parents. An Indonesian embassy spokesman in Singapore, quoted 
by Antara, said they had also been told that an Indonesian crew member 
had died -- possibly of SARS -- on a voyage from Hong Kong to Singapore. 
The virus has killed 60 people worldwide and infected 1,700. bs/sm/mfc

A Philippine crewman was killed when two foreign oil tankers collided 
off China's southern coast, the China Daily said Tuesday. The accident 
occurred over the weekend when a Maltese tanker was taking on oil 
from a Singaporean vessel off Dapeng Bay near the city of Shenzhen 
in southern China, the paper quoted a local maritime administrative 
bureau source as saying. Three others were injured. They were taken 
to a hospital in nearby Hong Kong. The accident caused fires and a 
small amount of oil leakage into the bay. Almost 30,000 tons of oil 
was scheduled to be transferred between the two vessels. The 30,000-ton 
Maltese "Byzantio" was seriously damaged but the Singaporean "Asian 
Progress II" was able to leave the area. cs/mfc China-ship

Virgin Blue refused to confirm previously flagged plans for a mid-year 
partial float Tuesday, amid reports the airline's co-owners Virgin 
Group and Patrick Corp. were at loggerheads over the issue. Richard 
Branson's Virgin Group wants to stick to the original timetable but 
Corrigan's Patrick Corp. is unwilling to reduce its 50 percent stake 
below 45 percent, according to a report in the Financial Review. Analysts 
said Corrigan's position made sense because a long-running slump in 
the global airline industry had been exacerbated by the war in Iraq 
and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis. "Branson 
is keen to get the money for other areas of Virgin Group but it's 
hard to argue with Patrick's position that the timing is wrong," said 
one Sydney-based analyst, who did not want to be named. "Virgin Blue 
generates a lot of cash, it doesn't need to list on the stock exchange 
and get a balance sheet, it an afford all of its capex (capital expenditure) 
needs." He said Patrick also had more selfish reasons for delaying 
the float as long as possible. When Patrick bought half of Virgin 
Blue for 260 million dollars (156 million US) in March last year, 
it also agreed on deferred payments of 30 million dollars for every 
100 million dollars the airline's market capitalisation rose above 
600 million dollars. With the market expected to value Virgin Blue 
at 1.0 to 1.5 billion dollars in the event of a partial float, Patrick 
could be forced to write a cheque for up to 270 million dollars. "If 
it avoids having Virgin Blue's market cap crystallised by a float 
then Patrick can continue to defer this payment or avoid it altogether," 
the analyst said. The reported spat is the first sign of tensions 
within Virgin Blue, which has taken more than 20 percent of the Australian 
domestic market since it began in 2000. In response to the reports, 
Virgin Blue said no timeline had been finalised for the float plans 
and Patrick refused to comment. Branson said last November that he 
expected Virgin Blue's net profit to exceed 100 million dollars this 
financial year. ns/dv Australia-air-Virgin-IPO-stocks-company

A Mexican airliner made a forced landing late Monday in Villahermosa 
after a passenger threatened to detonate a bomb he claimed he was 
carrying, Mexican television said. Authorities arrested a man who 
had been traveling on Aeromexico's Flight 510 from Villahermosa to 
Mexico City, but said no bomb was found in his possession, the official 
news agency Notimex said. Authorities inspected the plane which was 
then allowed to resume its journey to Mexico City. Around half of 
the 100-120 people on board the aircraft, according to officials' 
figures, got off the plane when it landed back at Villahermosa. str/gm/jlp/fgf

Many analysts predict a protracted bloodbath when coalition forces 
finally take on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's most loyal fighters 
in the streets of Baghdad. But in the country's second city of Basra, 
British troops are slowly claiming success in their bid to root out 
Saddam's forces while sparing themselves and local civilians a savage 
street-fight. The battle for Basra, a port and vital gateway for humanitarian 
supplies, provides an insight into how the coalition may be planning 
to take Baghdad and bring about the "implosion" of Saddam's regime. 
Having secured their supply lines to Kuwait in the south and surrounded 
the city with troops from the 7th Armoured Brigade, in recent days 
the British have begun surgical ground and air strikes against key 
symbols of the Iraqi leader's power. "The targeting and eradication 
of the Baath party within Basra province is now our primary focus 
and military main effort," British spokesman Colonel Chris Vernon 
told reporters in Kuwait City on Saturday. In one attack, British 
tanks made an incursion to destroy a statue of Saddam and disable 
the local television station, which was being used by the ruling Baath 
party to spread propaganda. "We are conducting aggressive patrols 
specifically targeting Baath party personnel to drive a wedge between 
the regime and the people," said Marcus Deville, a civilian spokesman 
for the British forces. At the same time as they attack Saddam's power 
structures in the city, British troops have also been using humanitarian 
relief and radio broadcasts to try to win over the terrified population. 
In one example on Monday, the strategies intersected. A Baath party 
headquarters five kilometres (three miles) southeast of the city was 
captured and British soldiers said they allowed civilians to loot 
vast stocks of food. Meanwhile the British have began broadcasting 
propaganda of their own into the homes of Basra's 1.2 million people. 
Between Western pop hits and traditional Arab music, an announcer 
says the days of the regime are numbered. Coalition commanders initially 
hoped to ignite a popular rebellion in Basra. The city has a mainly 
Shiite population which has been brutally supressed by the largely 
Sunni Muslim regime in Baghdad. "The planning assumption had always 
been that the advancing coalition forces would simply sweep past Basra 
and it would implode by itself," said Brigadier Jim Dutton, commander 
of 3 Commando Brigade. But the rebellion has failed to materialise 
and the Iraqi troops are putting up a determined defence. Some residents 
say they dare not rise up against Saddam's Baath party fighters until 
they can be sure the foreign troops are serious about finishing the 
job. The US government urged Iraq's Shiites to rebel after the last 
Gulf War in 1991, but failed to back the uprising with military support. 
Thousands were murdered in the ensuing crackdown. Fleeing civilians 
have told reporters the Saddam loyalists are killing men who refuse 
to fight. Several have said they were leaving to make it easier for 
the British to take the city. On a larger scale, a similar modus operandi 
is unfolding as US troops close on Baghdad. Whether or not it succeeds 
remains to be seen, but the Americans insist that despite the tenacious 
resistance they have encountered in the south, the people of Iraq 
share their desire for regime change. "We remain convinced of what 
we're seeing across the country, as we're having more and more success, 
that the Iraqi people are welcoming the departure of the regime and 
its destruction," US General Vincent Brooks said at Central Command 
base Monday. The most spectacular attempt to kill those around Saddam 
was the March 20 bombing of a bunker where the CIA had located the 
Iraqi leader and his sons Qusay and Uday, a day before the military 
was to begin the bombing of Baghdad. On Monday alone, air strikes 
targeted a Baath party headquarters in the central town of Al Hillah, 
a military headquarters building in the west, an intelligence centre 
in Karbala, also in the centre, and Saddam's cherished Republican 
Palace in Baghdad. But Brooks stressed that air strikes were only 
the most visible part of the strategy. Also at work were squads of 
special forces agents, he said. "Coalition special operations forces 
continue their operations and actions throughout Iraq. They're facilitating 
attacks against regime targets and death squads within urban areas," 
he said. "These attacks are enabled by information provided by the 
local populations." smc/rm/tm Iraq-war-Basra-Baghdad

The round-the-clock onslaught on Baghdad continued Tuesday with a 
dozen US cruise missiles bombarding the Iraqi capital as Saddam Hussein's 
elite Republican Guard faced their first significant battle with coalition 
forces on the ground. US forces also shot dead seven women and children 
after the civilian vehicle in which they were traveling failed to 
stop at a military checkpoint south of Baghdad. Saudi Foreign Minister 
Prince Saud al-Faisal urged Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to step down 
as a "sacrifice for his country", and in southern Iraq British forces 
attacked the outskirts of the port city of Basra. For the 12th day 
running, intense bombardments pounded the outskirts of Baghdad, where 
four divisions of the Republican Guard were hunkered down to defend 
the capital from any ground attack by US and British forces. AFP reporters 
said the raids were growing more intense and that the barrage late 
Monday seemed to be the heaviest yet to have hit the battered city's 
downtown area. Warplanes hit Baghdad and its southern outskirts, with 
two missiles crashing into Saddam's sprawling Republican Palace compound, 
the first such strike in broad daylight. In a television interview 
with an American station, Faisal said that since Saddam had "asked 
his people to sacrifice for the country ... he should be the first 
to sacrifice for his country. "If his staying in power (is) the only 
thing that brings problems to his country, we expect that he would 
respond to a sacrifice for his country, as he requires any citizen 
there to." South of the capital, US troops massing for a decisive 
push towards Saddam's seat of power reported their first serious fighting 
with Iraq's crack Republican Guard, considered Saddam's most determined 
military unit and key to the defense of Baghdad. US officers said 
200 Iraqis were killed, wounded or captured in the clashes which broke 
out overnight near Karbala, 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad. 
Reports of the battle around Karbala came as US armored units finalized 
plans for a decisive thrust toward Baghdad within a week, commanders 
said, with forces concentrated near Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) 
to the south. The US army's elite 101st Airborne Division clashed 
with Iraqi forces near Najaf, with Apache and Kiowa Warrior helicopters 
backing ground troops and striking military targets in and around 
the Shiite Muslim holy city. US President George W. Bush said the 
day of victory was drawing closer. "Many dangers lie ahead, but day 
by day we are moving closer to Baghdad. Day by day, we are moving 
closer to victory," he said at a ceremony in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
In Basra, seen as a key to controling southeast Iraq, British troops 
said they were waiting for reinforcements before making a final push 
to take the city. British commanders said 600 soldiers backed by tanks 
and armored vehicles were battling to punch through the town of Abu 
Al Khasib, 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the southeast of Basra, as 
British artillery pounded Basra's western edge. An Iraqi military 
spokesman said at least 54 US and British soldiers had been killed 
in fighting since Sunday, most of them around Basra, with an unspecified 
number of others killed in other parts of Iraq. US and British military 
sources put the death toll at 26 British and at least 39 US soldiers 
killed since the start of the war on March 20. The British defence 
ministry announced the latest death of one of its soldiers early Tuesday, 
saying only he had died "in the course of his duties" in southern 
Iraq. Three US troops were wounded Monday, one seriously, after Iraqi 
soldiers used a Red Crescent ambulance to stage an attack at a town 
north of Nasiriyah. Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri reiterated that 
some 5,000 Arab volunteers were ready to commit suicide attacks against 
coalition troops, emulating an Iraqi who killed four US soldiers in 
a car bomb attack near Najaf in central Iraq on Saturday. But US General 
Vincent Brooks dismissed the threats, telling reporters at the US 
Central Command's forward base in Qatar: "It's not a very effective 
military tactic at all. It's a terror tactic and it won't be effective." 
Despite the increase in fighting on several fronts, Britain acknowledged 
that coalition forces had not captured any top leaders or uncovered 
any of the weapons of mass destruction that Washington and London 
have accused Saddam of harboring. British Defence Secretary Geoff 
Hoon said the coalition was holding 8,000 Iraqi prisoners of war. 
But the United States has no intention of sending Iraqi prisoners 
to the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where the United States is 
accused of mistreating prisoners captured in Afghanistan. A Pentagon 
spokeswoman, Navy Lieutenant Commander Barbara Burfeind, said: "It 
is far too early in the conflict to make any decision regarding the 
future of those individuals who have come under the control of coalition 
forces. "But the US does not intend sending these EPWs (enemy prisoners 
of war) to Guantanamo." The US military's forward command center in 
Qatar also said US marines had seized a huge Iraqi ammunition supply 
depot in south-central Iraq, including ammunition, rifles, rocket-propelled 
grenades, mortars and other weapons. Syria and Iran hit back at US 
allegations that they were backing terrorist groups, with Tehran attributing 
the comments to setbacks for the coalition on the battlefield. On 
a lighter note, US girlie magazine Playboy threw its weight behind 
the war effort by deploying its Playmate centrefolds to boost battlefield 
morale. Los Angeles-based Playboy, the world's oldest skin magazine, 
said it was launching "Operation Playmate" to help perk up troops 
by allowing them to e-mail the centrefolds who will send back autographed 
photos of themselves. burs/dab Iraq-worldwrap

A key suspect in the Bali bombings has been included in the Indonesian 
resort island's pantheon of Hindu demons, with his effigy due to be 
torched later Tuesday during a religious purification ceremony. A 
two-meter (6.6 foot) papier-mache likeness of Amrozi was to be carried 
around this tourist beach resort -- now largely empty of foreigners 
following the October 12 terror blasts, which killed 202 people, mostly 
foreign tourists but also including 38 Indonesians. The effigy depicts 
Amrozi carrying two dynamite sticks with an evil deity known as Rangda 
clinging to his back, her matted white hair flowing in the wind. His 
trial is expected to start later this month and will be followed by 
those of 30 other suspects. Amrozi and three others could face the 
death penalty if convicted over the bombings. Amrozi's effigy will 
join about a dozen other Ogoh-Ogoh -- large papier-mache representations 
of evil spirits -- that will be noisily paraded around Sanur in a 
rite known as Ngerupuk to scare away demons and other spirits on the 
eve of the Nyepi festival. The Ogoh-Ogohs will end their short lives 
in flames at the beach Tuesday evening, with the remains cast into 
the sea. Similar parades will be held across the island. During Nyepi 
-- "Silent Day" -- on Wednesday, the island's international airport 
will close for 24 hours from 6:00 am, except for transit flights. 
Hindus should refrain from travelling outside their homes, lighting 
fires or using electrical power and making any noise. All shops, bars, 
restaurants and offices on the island are expected to shut. In past 
years everyone on the island -- including Indonesian Muslims and Christians 
and foreign tourists -- has been urged to stay home or in hotel rooms. 
An estimated 90 percent of Balinese follow the Hindu religion. Nyepi, 
which marks the start of the Hindu new year, is also a public holiday 
throughout mainly Muslim Indonesia. str/bs/sm/sdm/mfc Indonesia-attacks-festival

Indonesians in several cities staged another day of street protests 
on Tuesday against the US-led attack on Iraq, with some targeting 
US-franchised fast food chains. About 1,000 young people protested 
at Palembang in South Sumatra, handing out leaflets and displaying 
anti-war posters. Police said they were supporters of Muhammadiyah, 
the country's second largest Muslim organisation. At Semarang in Central 
Java about 50 students pulled down a Kentucky Fried Chicken sign. 
Police and security guards thwarted an attempt to topple a McDonald's 
sign. At Makassar in South Sulawesi, members of the Indonesian Muslim 
Student Association held an anti-war protest in front of the Japanese 
consulate, ElShinta radio said. Two representatives met consulate 
staff to air their objections to Tokyo's backing for the US invasion. 
Indonesia has seen daily protests since the attack began. The government 
has strongly criticised the war. bs/sm/mfc Iraq-war-demos-Indonesia

consecutive day, an AFP reporter said. A missile or smart bomb crashed 
into the heart of the compound on the 13th day of the war. The sprawling 
palace grounds, a potent symbol of President Saddam Hussein's grip 
on power, has been a frequent target of the bombardments. Around a

Air raid sirens sounded in Kuwait Tuesday hours after defence forces 
fired a Patriot missile in the direction of a suspicious target, an 
AFP correspondent reported. The all-clear signal was sounded several 
minutes later and no explosions were heard. A spokesman of the Kuwaiti 
army said earlier that a Patriot missile was fired early Tuesday after 
a monitoring station reported a hostile object in the skies over the 
north of the country. Some 17 missiles have been fired at Kuwait since 
the start of the war in neighbouring Iraq, but they have caused relatively 
little damage. Two people were slightly injured Sunday when a low-flying 
missile landed in the sea close to a waterfront shopping mall. co/kir

Malaysia is free from the killer pneumonia virus which has hit neighbouring 
Singapore and other Asian countries hard as it spreads worldwide, 
officials said Tuesday. "Malaysia is free from the Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS)," a senior official with the health ministry told 
AFP. "There are no confirmed cases or deaths caused by SARS in the 
country," he said. Health ministry director general Mohamad Taha Arif 
said there had been "41 notifications to our operations centres from 
March 18 until Sunday" but all patients had been found to be free 
of SARS. The virus causing SARS, a mystery respiratory illness which 
first erupted in southern China and has been transported to North 
America and Europe by travellers, has yet to be identified by scientists. 
The Malaysian health ministry official urged the public to remain 
calm and avoid travel to affected countries. "If you are going to 
Singapore, please wear a face mask and avoid visiting SARS patients," 
he said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has listed Singapore, 
Toronto, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Chinese cities of Beijing, 
Shanxi and Guangdong as affected areas. Singapore is among the worst 
hit, with four deaths and the number of reported cases now standing 
at 92, with 47 in hospital and 41 discharged so far. Malaysia's Health 
Minister Chua Jui Meng was in the southern Johor state bordering Singapore 
Tuesday to inspect measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. 
"There should be more personnel at the entry points, not so much to 
prevent people from coming in but to advise those who have visible 
symptoms of SARS to seek medical advice as soon as possible," he said. 
Asked what the government would do in relation to a Singaporean women 
who died Monday after she returned from a visit to Malaysia's eastern 
Sarawak state, the health official said the government was seeking 
further information on the case from Singapore. He said all hospitals 
had set up isolation wards to cater for anyone suspected of having 
SARS and that a public awareness campaign had been launched. jsm/lb/pch

Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels have denied attacking a troop carrier, 
raising fresh fears for the island's fragile Norwegian-arranged ceasefire, 
officials said Tuesday. A Scandinavian team monitoring the ceasefire 
between government forces and the rebel Tamil Tigers said the guerrillas 
had denied involvement in the attack late Monday in which three soldiers 
were wounded. "The LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) says they 
have nothing to do with this," a spokesman for the Sri Lanka Monitoring 
Mission said. The denial raised fears that other militant groups could 
be operating in an area where the Tigers were thought to be exercising 
an iron grip control, official sources and diplomats said. The Tigers 
have also denied any knowledge of the sinking of a Chinese trawler 
off the island's northeastern coast 12 days ago which killed 17 Chinese 
crewmen. In Monday's incident, the navy destroyed what it believed 
was a Tamil Tiger craft that opened fire on a ferry that was taking 
more than 1,200 government soldiers to the northern peninsula of Jaffna. 
The navy claimed that an LTTE dinghy emerged from a cluster of fishing 
boats some 20 kilometres (13 miles) east of the northeastern port 
of Trincomalee and opened fire on the MV Lanka Muditha, military officials 
said. They said a navy attack craft that was escorting the troop carrier 
fired on and destroyed the Tiger vessel. At least two rebels were 
believed to have been aboard the dinghy. The troop carrier resumed 
its journey after the attack and reached its destination Tuesday morning. 
"The navy stepped up security for Lanka Muditha and it safely reached 
its original destination at Kankesanthurai," a military source said. 
"We called in additional gun boats to escort the troop carrier." The 
latest confrontation came three weeks after the Sri Lankan navy sank 
a LTTE merchant vessel in disputed waters, killing 12 guerrillas. 
Truce monitors had said they did not have enough evidence to apportion 
blame, but criticised both for not avoiding the incident. The Norwegian-brokered 
truce between the rebels and the government has been in place since 
February 23. At the latest round of peace talks in Japan 11 days ago, 
both sides agreed to put in place measures to prevent clashes at sea 
and ensure that the ceasefire is not violated. The Tigers, who have 
an effective naval unit known as the Sea Tigers, have targeted the 
Lanka Muditha on several occasions, but troops managed to beat them 
back. Three decades of ethnic bloodshed in Sri Lanka have claimed 
more than 60,000 lives since 1972. aj/an/sdm SriLanka-Tamil

Livestock in southern China may be the source of the mysterious virus 
that has killed more than 60 people and caused a global health scare, 
sources close to the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Tuesday. 
"WHO is working on a theory that the virus has its source in farm 
animals in southern China," a source close to the Geneva-based body 
told AFP. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which erupted 
in southern China's Guangdong province has spread to Hong Kong and 
been taken worldwide in an unprecedented fashion by airline passengers. 
"In some areas in Guangdong province in southern China, people just 
live neck to jaw with animals -- pigs, chickens, ducks are everywhere," 
the source said. Scientists have already ruled out a link between 
SARS and bird flu, also a viral disease highly contagious to chickens, 
ducks, turkeys and other birds but not dangerous to other animals 
and humans. Asked to confirm the links between SARS and farm animals 
in southern China, Peter Cordingley, the spokesman for the Manila-based 
Western Pacific WHO regional office, said: "At this stage, we are 
not saying this is the cause but is certainly something we are looking 
into in the general scheme of things." Cordingley said the WHO was 
still awaiting authorisation from the Chinese authorities to pay a 
visit to Guangdong province, where the SARS outbreak occurred way 
back in November. Jean-Marc Olive, the WHO representative to the Philippines, 
said in a separate interview on government television that experts 
were still "laboratory researching" for leads that could lead to the 
discovery of the virus. "Now there is a possible lead that it is a 
virus infecting animals that jumped to various species as it has happened 
in the past and its another way to try to investigate these cases 
and discover the virus," Olive told NBN television. China has come 
under fire from various quarters for providing little information 
about the epidemic in the south of the world's most populous nation 
where 34 people have died so far, according to Chinese authorities. 
The mysterious illness has now infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries 
and killed at least 62 people. Hitoshi Oshitani, a Manila-based WHO 
expert on communicable disease, said viruses of many emerging diseases 
were known to have come from animals by "crossing species barriers." 
He cited as examples the deadly incurable haemorrhagic fever Ebola, 
whose virus is suspected to have come from monkeys and another killer 
virus, the Nipah virus, which may have originated from bats. The Nipah 
virus is named after the location where it was first detected in Malaysia 
in 1999, when pigs were reported to be the apparent source of infection 
among most human cases. The Nipah virus is a member of the virus family 
called paramyxoviridae. The family includes the paramyxovirus, which 
the WHO has not ruled out as a possible cause for SARS, perhaps working 
in conjunction with another virus family called coronavirus. The paramyxovirus 
causes common illnesses like mumps and measles while the coronavirus 
caused the common cold. Oshitani told AFP that the viruses linked 
to SARS are known to be different from those currently infecting humans. 
He said that some laboratories, including France's Pasteur Institute 
in Paris, found the coronavirius while others discovered the paramyxovirus 
in samples of SARS patients. "But we still don't know what is the 
relationship between the two viruses in terms of being the causative 
agent of SARS," he said. On Monday, Oshitani said scientists working 
in 11 laboratories around the world were just days away from identifying 
the virus that causes SARS. "We still need some more time to find 
what is the real cause of the SARS outbreak and how these two viruses 
evolve in the disease history." Oshitani said that SARS virus was 
more dangerous than the Ebola virus "in terms of infectivity but in 
terms of severity and case fatality rates, it is less dangerous." 
He said SARS was the "most significant outbreak of a disease through 
air travel in history" while the international collaboration to determine 
its cause is "the biggest for an emerging disease." pp/jvg/pch Health-pneumonia-Asia-virus

Australia blames Europe and Japan for stalled agriculture trade talks 
by Neil Sands ATTENTION - ADDS EU quarantine challenge /// SYDNEY, 
April 1 (AFP) - Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile on Tuesday accused 
Japan and the European Union (EU) of jeopardising moves toward global 
free trade by making the World Trade Organization (WTO) miss a key 
deadline on agricultural reform. Vaile said foot dragging by anti-reformists 
among the 145-member WTO had led to the organisation missing its March 
31 deadline for agreeing on the "modalities" -- or nuts and bolts 
details -- of freeing up farm trade. He warned the WTO's entire global 
trade liberalisation program could now become bogged down. "The responsibility 
for this failure sits squarely at the feet of those members, such 
as the EU and Japan, who are continuing to oppose efforts to bring 
about genuine trade reform of agricultural trade," he said. "It is 
time for some serious political leadership by the EU." Vaile said 
if no progress was made he would call a meeting in Geneva of the pro-reform 
Cairns Group, which has 18 members including Australia, Canada, Indonesia 
and Argentina. He is also likely to lobby developing nations in a 
bid to increase pressure for reform. "We will not sit idly by and 
watch the Europeans work up another no-reform proposal that will preserve 
agricultural protection for decades to come," Vaile said. The Cairns 
Group has proposed farm tariffs in developed countries be cut to a 
maximum of 25 percent but the EU and Japan advocate a slower approach, 
taking into account the role of farming in issues such as environmental 
protection and food security. Vaile has previously cited Japan's rice 
tariff of 778 percent and the EU sugar tariff of 228 percent as examples 
of unacceptable practices. Most recently, he condemned Japan's decision 
last week to hike tariffs on Australian beef imports from 38.5 percent 
to 50 percent from August. Vaile dismissed an EU move to challenge 
Australia's strict quarantine regime in the WTO as an attempt to divert 
attention from the Europeans' intransigence on farm subsidies. "Australia 
has a world-class quarantine system that is science-based and transparent, 
whereas the EU's system is not transparent," he said. "The EU's efforts 
would be better directed towards weaning its farmers from subsidies 
and getting on with the process of agriculture reform, as was agreed 
by all ministers in Doha." Agriculture has proved a crucial stumbling 
block in the implementation of the WTO's so-called Doha round of trade 
reform, which is due to be completed by the end of 2004. The Doha 
talks also cover other trade areas including services and industrial 
tariffs such as anti-dumping measures. Opposition trade spokesman 
Craig Emerson said the WTO strategy for global tariff reform was being 
undermined by a succession of bilateral free trade agreements, such 
as the one currently being negotiated between Australia and the United 
States. Emerson likened the WTO's problem to that faced by the United 
Nations over Iraq, where coalition partners acted against Iraq without 
waiting for approval from the UN. "The world is living dangerously, 
with multilateral institutions being undermined by bilateral and regional 
efforts," he said. ns/dv WTO-trade-agriculture-Australia

Malaysian police have detained an Australian musician for allegedly 
engaging in "unnatural sex" with a local sailor and videotaping the 
act, a report said Tuesday. Magistrate Hazizah Kassim Monday remanded 
the Australian in custody for five days for the alleged act of gross 
indecency, The Star newspaper said. If convicted he could be jailed 
for up to two years. The 35-year-old sailor said he met the unnamed 
Australian, described in the newspaper as "a sub-principal of an orchestra", 
via the Internet, The Star said. The two men agreed to meet at a hotel 
here last Friday and the sailor was invited to a house where he was 
given a drink, after which he alleges he became semi-conscious. He 
said that during this time he was sexually assaulted and the act was 
videotaped. The sailor said that when he regained consciousness the 
following morning he demanded 50,000 ringgit (13,000 dollars) to "solve 
the problem," the newspaper reported. When the Australian refused 
to pay, he reported the incident to the police. Australian deputy 
high commissioner Nick Brown confirmed to AFP that an Australian had 
been detained but declined to elaborate. str/lb/rcw Malaysia-Australia-sex

Intense bombing of Baghdad and Saddam palace, civilian death toll 
climbs by Nayla Razzouk = (PICTURES) = BAGHDAD, April 1 (AFP) - More 
and more missiles and bombs battered Baghdad into Tuesday as civilian 
death tolls rose ever higher with US-led forces stepping up the pummeling 
of the Iraqi regime. Around a dozen missiles crashed into the Iraqi 
capital overnight and around 09:00 (0600 GMT) the main presidential 
palace compound was hit for the second consecutive day. An AFP reporter 
saw a missile or smart bomb crash into the heart of the Republican 
Palace complex on the 13th day of the war. The sprawling palace grounds, 
a potent symbol of President Saddam Hussein's grip on power, has been 
a frequent target of the bombardments. At US central command in Qatar, 
a military spokesamn admitted that US troops, fearful of a fresh suicide 
attack, opened fire on a civilian vehicle at a checkpoint in Iraq, 
killing seven women and children. The shooting occurred at a checkpoint 
manned by soldiers from the US Army's Third Infantry Division at Najaf, 
150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad, on Monday afternoon, Navy 
Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said. The admission came after 
villagers on the edge of the capital reported 20 more civilians dead, 
11 of them children, from the blitz. Intense bombardments also kept 
pounding the outskirts of the city, where four divisions of Saddam's 
elite Republican Guard were dug in to defend the capital from any 
ground attack. AFP reporters said the raids are getting worse and 
that the latest barrage during night 12 of the war to topple Saddam 
seemed to be the heaviest yet to have hit the city centre. The ominous 
whistle of the missiles was heard in the sky before a series of explosions 
shook the city, appearing to knock out electricity in entire neighbourhoods. 
Balls of smoke slowly merged into a single cloud overhead. Official 
sites of the regime appeared to have been hit. Two missiles were seen 
smashing into the Republican Palace compound along the banks of the 
Tigris River, which had aleady been pounded earlier in the day. The 
eerie silence in the aftermath of the raid was broken only by the 
wail of ambulance sirens, their flashing red lights criss-crossing 
the main avenue along the river. Coalition forces say thousands of 
attack sorties have been carried out since the war began March 20, 
with 1,000 on Sunday alone. The information ministry was hit earlier 
Monday, and domestic television was knocked out for several hours. 
Foreign journalists who were housed in a press centre on the ground 
floor of the ministry have moved out and the authorities have opened 
media offices in a city hotel. Hundreds of thousands of phone lines 
have been bombed out of action. Hospital sources said coalition bombing 
killed six Iraqis and wounded dozens of others in a Baghdad residential 
neighbourhood Monday. Elsewhere, an AFP journalist was accompanied 
to Janabiyah village on the southeastern edge of Baghdad, where residents 
said 11 children were among 20 people killed when missiles hit five 
sleeping families on a farm Saturday night. The victims had already 
been buried according to Muslim tradition but the stench of death 
still hung over the farm. One building had been flattened, and the 
carcasses of dead animals were black with swarms of flies. Schoolbooks 
soaked in blood testified to the carnage. The United States and Britain 
say the war will not be finished until Saddam's 24-year grip on power 
is ended. State television, as it has done many times since the war 
began, underscored Saddam was still in control of the country. It 
showed him chairing a meeting of top aides including Uday, his elder 
son, who was being shown on television for the first time since the 
war began. It said the footage had been recorded Monday. Uday heads 
the Saddam Fedayeen militia, intensely loyal fighters who have joined 
regular Iraqi forces in mounting fierce resistance to US and British 
ground troops in the south hoping to push their way to Baghdad. Iraq 
says Baghdad will be a "cemetery" for coalition forces and claims 
more than 4,000 people from across the Arab world have come to the 
capital, ready to "martyr" themselves in suicide attacks. AFP reporters 
in Lebanon and Jordan saw dozens of volunteers board buses headed 
for Iraq to volunteer for the war. A senior US commander said US forces 
were stopping people from travelling through the western desert towards 
Baghdad. An Iraqi military spokesman said at least 54 US and British 
soldiers had been killed in the previous 24 hours, most in the south 
of the country. bur/bp/kir Iraq-war-Baghdad

China shows few signs of abandoning its harsh policies against the 
banned Falungong spiritual movement, and may have succeeded in its 
attempt to quell the group, the US government said. In its annual 
human rights report, the State Department detailed the severe methods 
adopted against the group, which Beijing previous called the most 
formidable challenge to its power in a decade. "Police often used 
excessive force when detaining peaceful (Falungong) protesters, including 
some who were elderly or who were accompanied by small children," 
the report said. "During the year, there were numerous credible reports 
of abuse and even killings of ... practitioners by the police and 
other security personnel." The Falungong movement, which previously 
claimed millions of followers in China, was banned as an "evil cult" 
in 1999 and has been the target of a relentless campaign since then. 
Over the past four years "thousands of practitioners were incarcerated 
in prisons, extrajudicial reeducation-through-labor camps, psychiatric 
facilities or special deprogramming centers," the report said. Police 
were involved in "beatings, detention under extremely harsh conditions, 
and torture (including by electric shock and by having hands and feet 
shackled and linked with crossed steel chains)," it said. The report 
noted that the Chinese government's tough line might have borne fruit, 
reflected in a marked fall in open protests staged by group followers. 
"Adherents conducted far fewer public demonstrations than in past 
years, which some observers attributed to the effectiveness of the 
Government's crackdown," it said. However, Falungong followers are 
not safe from government persecution even if they refrain from participating 
in any demonstrations, according to the report. "Mere belief in the 
discipline, without any outward manifestation of its tenets, has been 
sufficient grounds for practitioners to receive punishments ranging 
from loss of employment to imprisonment, and in many cases, to suffer 
torture and death," it said. ph/cs/pch US-rights-China-sect

Too much red tape has prevented the Rolling Stones from giving Indian 
fans satisfaction in the past, according to lead singer Mick Jagger. 
The band are to due to play in India for the first time ever -- in 
the country's technology capital, Bangalore, on April 4 and the financial 
hub of Bombay on April 7. "To tell you the truth, India has never 
been on the regular tour map. It's been quite difficult in the past 
with the bureaucracy being so much worse than now," Jagger told the 
Hindustan Times daily. For a rock concert to be held in India the 
organisers require permission from at least a dozen government departments 
including three police departments, corporation and federal authorities. 
The group has just completed the first half of its "40 Licks World 
Tour" with 50 sell-out gigs in the United States and eight in Australia. 
But the rock-and-roll band had to cancel shows in Hong Kong and China 
following a health scare due the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
(SARS) in the region. Jagger, who visited in India in 1996 to watch 
World Cup cricket matches, said the other members of the group were 
"really, really keen," to perform before Indian audiences. In another 
interview to the Times of India Jagger, 59 said he had outlasted his 
contemporaries due to luck. But he said he did not take seriously 
the knighthood awarded to him last year. "I still have to find time 
to accept it. From the beginning I have always had friends from all 
layers of society. Actually, British society is very porous, unlike 
say French and I have refused to be pigeon-holed," he said. The singer 
said British singer Robbie Williams was the next kid on the block. 
"Of course he has stolen a lot from me. But much of it is his own. 
He is provocative, entertaining... not just a recording artist," he 
said. jay/er/an/rcw India-music-Stones

Crack US troops unnerved by Iraqis firing from ambulance, garbage 
truck by Tim Sloan = (PICTURE) = SOUTHERN IRAQ, April 1 (AFP) - Paratrooper 
Zach Talraas nursed his wounds on a hospital bed and shook his head 
at how Iraqi troops firing from a garbage truck and an ambulance could 
face down the the US army's elite 82nd Airborne Division. "It makes 
the job a lot tougher. You have to take a second or half a second 
before you can start firing in reference to determining if a target 
is hostile or friendly like the ambulance," the private from Delta 
325 Company said. The 82nd Airborne is one of the United States' most 
celebrated and battle-tested units but it was clearly caught off guard 
by the unconventional Iraqi tactics. The firefight left several wounded, 
at least two seriously, and men like Talraas unnerved. "Saddam's whole 
thing is to make us look like the bad guys in reference to having 
to fight against guerilla tactics and people using ambulances as cover," 
he said. The platoon had been tasked with securing two bridges in 
the city. Taking the first bridge "was almost too easy", said Talraas, 
but the next part of the mission was anything but. US troops driving 
in humvees first came under fire from civilian vehicles, hitting back 
with 50 caliber rounds and Mark 19 grenade launchers. They were again 
taken by surprise when a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) was fired 
at them from a garbage truck, said Talraas. "A man hiding in a dumpster 
fired an RPG at one of the humvees. Several soldiers received small 
shrapnel wounds but were able to continue fighting. The dumpster was 
destroyed with return fire," he said. The respite was brief however 
as a white ambulance with red flashing lights crossed the bridge and 
headed straight for the US troops before its occupants also opened 
fire. US troops returned fire and the ambulance retreated but they 
were then were pinned down by sniper fire for the better part of an 
hour before a decision was made to break contact, pull back and regroup. 
Talraas tried to take cover behind his gun turret on the humvee but 
was injured in the shooting. His driver was shot in the hand. "My 
driver screamed and then I felt myself get shot," said Talraas. "It 
was pretty scary. It reminded me of a scene from (the Vietnam war 
movie) Full Metal Jacket." Talraas stayed in his gun turret "to lay 
down suppressive fire as we had another platoon on foot next to the 
humvee and couldn't just leave them". The shooting eventually died 
down and the soldiers were able to retreat. But Talraas said the incident 
had highlighted that the rules of combat in Iraq are anything but 
black and white. "All the combatants were in civilian clothing and 
not using any military vehicles," he said. Talraas was being treated 
at an Iraqi air base captured by coalition forces. One of the casualties 
has been flown out of Iraq. ts-co/pm/dab Iraq-war-ambulance

The acting president of Nauru had suffered a heart attack, less than 
a month after his predecessor died in a US hospital, Australian foreign 
ministry officials said Tuesday. A foreign affairs spokeswoman said 
acting president Derog Gioura was undergoing treatment at an unnamed 
Australian hospital and was expected to survive. Gioura, 71, was named 
acting president of the tiny Pacific nation in March after his predecessor 
Bernard Dowiyogo -- a diabetic for 30 years -- died following a marathon 
11-hour heart operation in Washington. The Australian official said 
Gioura would remain head of a caretaker administration until elections 
scheduled for May. "He is still acting president," she said. "The 
parliament has been dissolved and elections aren't until May, so it 
doesn't change anything. "He's undergoing treatment." Nauru is home 
to 12,000 Micronesian people living on a single 21 square kilometre 
(eight square mile) island that has been scarred by a century of phosphate 
strip-mining. Once among the world's richest people thanks to phosphate 
royalties, the country is now effectively bankrupt. ns/rcw Nauru-president

Hong Kong and Singapore offer Asia's friendliest environments for 
Internet-based business, reflecting their governments' strong support 
for electronic commerce, a survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit 
(EIU) showed. In contrast, the lower rankings of other Asian countries 
such as Thailand and China are a reminder of how telecommunications 
monopolies, the absence of state-led initiatives and poverty can hold 
back an economy from leveraging on the commercial potential arising 
from the Internet, it said. In a global survey of 60 countries with 
10 as the best possible score, Hong Kong led the region with a score 
of 8.20 points in "e-readiness," which placed the territory in 10th 
position along with Canada, behind world leader Sweden. Hong Kong's 
arch economic rival Singapore was ranked 12th with a score of 8.18 
points followed by South Korea in 16th position with 7.80 points, 
the London-based EIU said. At the lower end of the spectrum, Malaysia 
occupied 33rd spot, followed by Thailand which placed 42nd and India, 
a software leader, was ranked 46th with the Philippines one place 
behind. Emerging Asian economic powerhouse China was ranked 50th, 
Indonesia placed 53rd and Vietnam was a further three spots behind. 
The EIU's annual rankings report, now into its fourth edition, defines 
e-readiness as the "extent to which a market is conducive to Internet-based 
opportunities." It takes into account a number of factors including 
the quality of information technology (IT) infrastructure, government 
initiatives and the commercial efficiencies provided by the Internet. 
Asia's top performers all displayed common traits including sound 
IT infrastructure, high per capita income, significant telecoms deregulation, 
falling transaction costs, pro-active government approach to e-commerce, 
good education systems and openness to trade and ideas, the EIU said. 
"Asian governments view the Internet as key to gaining a competitive 
edge in the regional and global marketplace, and they are making increasingly 
ambitious plans," it said. "In addition to creating policies that 
support e-business, Asian countries are bringing e-business into government 
itself," the EIU said. For example, residents in Hong Kong can carry 
out many of their government-related transactions in cyberspace, such 
as paying taxes and making appointments with immigration authorities. 
Of Asia's three leading e-commerce economies, South Korea is making 
the fastest progress in the race to exploit the commercial opportunities 
arising from the Internet, the EIU said. "The saturation of densely 
populated urban commercial and residential districts with cheap telephone 
and broadband networks put South Korea in a unique position to exploit 
e-commerce," the EIU said. bh/rc/dv Asia-tech-survey-EIU

points at 4,337.61 on turnover of 30.54 billion Taiwan dollars (879 
million US). The electronics sector led the broad market higher on 
technical factors and bargain-hunting propelled by pre-AGM buying, 
expectations of solid March sales and probably government support 
in some stocks such as TSMC and UMC, dealers said. Risers led decliners 
319 to 287, with 124 stocks unchanged. "Some institutional investors 
continued to place sell programmes while some hunted for bargains 
on technical factors," Yunda Securities Consultant vice president 
Tom Tang said. "There were also expectations of a technical recovery 
today after yesterday's steep falls." Chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor 
Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) closed down 0.10 at 42.20 and United Microelectronics 
Corp. (UMC) was up 0.10 at 19.40, with bargain-hunting and possible

BAGHDAD, April 1 (AFP) - US-British forces bombarded the main presidential 
palace complex in the Iraqi capital on Tuesday morning for the second 
consecutive day, an AFP reporter said. A plume of smoke rose into 
the air after a missile or smart bomb crashed into the heart of the 
compound on the 13th day of the war around 9 am (0600 GMT). Baghdadis 
however continued to move around the city. The sprawling palace grounds, 
a potent symbol of President Saddam Hussein's grip on power, has been 
a frequent target of the bombardments and was struck twice on Monday. 
During the afternoon a warplane buzzed the compound, the largest of 
eight presidential palaces in the capital, and launched a missile 
which was followed by two more missile strikes in the evening. Around 
a dozen missiles had struck the Iraqi capital overnight. jch/bp/kir

South Korea's defense ministry denied reports Tuesday that North Korea 
had test-fired a missile into the Yellow Sea. "There was no sign that 
North Korea test-fired a missile today," a ministry spokesman told 
AFP. "That's our ministry's official stance on the issue." South Korea 
issued the denial some three hours after Japan said that North Korea 
had test-fired another anti-ship missile from its western coast earlier 
Tuesday. North Korea test-fired short-range anti-ship missiles on 
February 24 and March 10 off its east coast into the Sea of Japan. 
"A missile was launched today at around 10:15 am (0115 GMT)," a Japanese 
defense agency spokesman said in Tokyo. "But we don't know any more 
details." Japanese officials said the launch site was Hwajinri in 
Pyongannam province and said the missile's range was 60 kilometres 
(38 miles). Yonhap news agency cited military analysts as saying North 
Korea may have test-fired an artillery weapon, rather than a missile.

and anxiety as it took over the nation's postal services and some 
359 trillion yen (3.0 trillion dollars) in savings and insurance funds. 
President Masaharu Ikuta, in noting the biggest change in the postal 
services' 132-year history, promised to improve services and vowed 
the firm would accumulate net profit of 4.0 trillion yen in the four 
years to March 2007. "We promise to work together so that people will 
say that postal services have improved since the launch of Japan Post," 
Ikuta said at a banner-unveiling ceremony at the headquarters in Tokyo. 
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said it was a "first step" in realising 
one of his long-held pet reform projects, hatched even before becoming 
president of the Liberal Democratic Party when he served as minister 
of post and telecommunications in the mid-1990s. "This is effectively 
the first step toward privatisation," he said. "I want them to improve 
management and privatise this business smoothly so the government 
can sell their shares in it at high prices." Ikuta has been lauded 
as a champion of reform for helping resuscitate Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, 
Japan's second largest shipping company. But critics wondered whether 
he could steer the massive postal system, with 280,000 employees and 
24,700 post offices nationwide, toward privatisation. "The original 
idea of the reform was to break the monopoly on postal services and 
reform the postal savings and insurance systems, whic can cause chaos 
in the financial markets," the Mainichi newspaper wrote in an editorial 
Tuesday. "The route from public corporation to privatisation must 
be made clear, but so far, we have seen no signposts," it said. There 
are high hurdles to enter nationwide mail delivery services. Among 
other conditions, the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, 
Posts and Telecommunications require newcomers to ordinary mail services 
to install at least 99,000 postboxes nationwide. The number is equivalent 
to about 60 percent of the postboxes currently installed. As of Tuesday, 
only five parcel delivery firms using motorcycles had applied to operate 
mail delivery services in limited regions, which do not require the 
establishment of postboxes. mis-rn/ja/dv Japan-post-privatisation-company-economy

Beijing authorities have launched a crackdown on bogus health products 
and have targeted tonics boasting the ability to enhance sexual performance, 
official media reported Tuesday. Health officials making on-the-spot 
checks have so far found 125 kinds of health foods which were illegally 
advertised as being effective in treating sexual dysfunctions, the 
China Daily quoted Cai Changjing, an official with the Beijing Health 
Supervision Office as saying. Inspectors seized products from shelves 
and plan to fine the producers as well as distributors. The market 
is flooded with all varieties of medicine, food and health products 
making dubious claims. One type of capsule claimed to be effective 
in enhancing sexual ability, but its ingredients were made up of nothing 
but black sesame seed, Chinese yam, mulberry fruit and wild jujube, 
the Beijing Youth Daily said. Other products include pearl powder 
which some suppliers claim can treat high blood pressure, but has 
no such proven capabilities. Consumers have complained the products 
not only do not work but cause side effects including heart palpitations 
and nervousness. cs/rcw China-health-medicine

Manchester United, the world's richest soccer club, have announced 
reduced profits of 20.3 million pounds (32 million dollars) for the 
six months to the end of January. Higher media revenues and more home 
cup games lifted turnover in the six months to January 31 by 13 percent 
to 92.6 million pounds (146 million dollars) while operating profits 
before player sales rose 32 percent to 31.1 million pounds (49 million 
dollars). However, pre-tax profits were 34 percent lower because the 
club raked in less cash in transfer market. In the previous period, 
the club generated 16.3 million pounds from selling Jaap Stam to Italian 
club Lazio and Andy Cole to English side Blackburn. "We have significantly 
improved our operating performance," said chief executive Peter Kenyon. 
"The strength of the balance sheet and our diversified revenue streams 
have increased the resilience and competitiveness of Manchester United. 
"Looking ahead, we have a clear strategy focusing on the development 
of media rights, the conversion of more fans to customers and the 
leveraging of our global brand." Last month, Kenyon said failure to 
land a trophy for the second successive season would be unacceptable. 
United are second to Arsenal in the English Premiership and play nine-times 
European Cup winners Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals 
this month. bur/rw03 Fbl-ENG-Pr-ManUtd-profits

Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel) said Tuesday its wholly-owned 
subsidiary Singapore Post (SingPost) plans to raise 300 million Singapore 
dollars (169.50 million US) through a bond issue. Proceeds from the 
10-year unsecured bonds will be used by the postal operator to fund 
operations, anticipated capital expenditure and working capital requirements, 
SingTel said in a statement. DBS Bank and UBS AG will manage the bond 
issue. The Standard and Poor's ratings agency has assigned an A-plus 
preliminary rating to the proposed bond issue subject to final documentation 
and pricing, SingTel said in a statement. SingPost is the dominant 
provider of domestic and international postal services in the city-state. 
SingTel also said Monday it plans to list SingPost but has yet to 
determine the size and pricing of the initial public offering. SingPost 
reported a net profit of 101 million Singapore dollars in the year 
to March 2002, on revenue of 381 million dollars. mba/rc/dv Singapore-post-telecom-bonds-company

Australia's ANZ banking announced Tuesday that it has signed a cooperation 
agreement with the Shanghai Rural Credit Cooperative Union. The deal 
enables the two financial institutions to swap information with the 
aim of identifying specific areas in which they may cooperate in the 
future, ANZ Banking Group Ltd. said in a statement. "The Shanghai 
Rural Credit Cooperative Union's established customer base and network 
in Shanghai and ANZ's technology and product expertise could provide 
joint opportunities in the medium-term," ANZ strategic development 
managing director Peter Hawkins said. The Shanghai Rural Credit Cooperative 
Union, which has total assets of 17 billion Australian dollars (1.0 
billion US) brings together 230 rural credit cooperatives. It reports 
to the Shanghai municipal government and the People's Bank of China.

Retailers in Germany saw a marginal increase in business in February, 
when retail sales edged up by 0.4 percent from a year earlier in real 
or price-adjusted terms, data published by the Federal Statistics 
Office on Tuesday showed. Analysts had been forecasting a drop of 
around 1.0 percent on a 12-month basis. In nominal terms, however, 
German retail sales slipped by 0.2 percent in February from the year-earlier 
figure, the office said in a statement. Compared with January, sales 
were down by 1.2 percent in real and by 1.1 percent in nominal terms, 
the statement said. spm/km/yad Germany-economy-retail-sales

Indonesia's defence ministry Tuesday defended a policy document which 
calls for the military's close scrutiny of civilian affairs to be 
maintained. The "territorial function", which entails the presence 
of military posts alongside civilian posts down to village level, 
was blamed for the armed forces' domination of civil affairs during 
the autocratic rule of president Suharto. Defence ministry spokesman 
Abdul Azis denied that the maintenance of the territorial function 
would undermine efforts at military reform. The white paper, launched 
on Monday, focuses on strategies to maintain Indonesia's territorial 
integrity, Azis said. There is strong separatist sentiment in Aceh 
and Papua provinces. Azis said the territorial role was necessary 
for the military to deal with internal threats such as terrorism, 
separatism, radicalism and transnational crimes. "Because of our lack 
of resources in terms of funding and technology, our doctrine is defence 
by the whole population. Therefore, soldiers need to be close to the 
people," Azis said. Azis said the military is committed to reform. 
"We want the military to be professional and not involved in practical 
politics." There has also been recent controversy over a provision 
in a bill which would authorise the armed forces chief to deploy troops 
during an emergency without prior approval from the president. Although 
President Megawati Sukarnoputri is seen as close to the military, 
it has lost influence since Suharto's departure in 1998. Next year 
it loses its reserved seats in parliament. Political analyst Dewi 
Fortuna Anwar, quoted by the Jakarta Post, said a close relationship 
between the military and civilians "creates negative influences for 
the soldiers because civilians have different values which often contradict 
military values, especially in dealing with political and business 
matters." Rizal Sukma of the Centre for Strategic and International 
Studies said the territorial function was not the answer to separatist 
issues. "What we need is a development of the defence force that enables 
us to deal with various external threats." tn/sm/rcw Indonesia-military

Tuberculosis vaccine administered to babies may make them resistant 
to developing asthma later in life, Australian researchers said Tuesday. 
The scientists at Sydney's Woolcock Institute of Medical Research 
said their study of how early viral infections could protect against 
allergies later in life raised the possibility of someday developing 
a vaccine against asthma. Guy Marks, head of epidemiology at the Woolcock 
Institute, said the research team set out to test whether tuberculosis 
(TB) vaccinations reduced the incidence of allergies, asthma, eczema 
and hay fever during childhood. The Sydney test involved two groups 
of children aged seven to 14, 309 of whom were vaccinated against 
TB and 442 who were not. The researchers found that asthma rates were 
lower among members of the vaccinated group, notably among those with 
a family history of allergies. "In those who had a family history 
of allergic disease the ones who had the vaccine as a child were less 
likely to have asthma," Marks said. He said the vaccination did not 
appear to have any impact on eczema, hay fever or allergies, but the 
reason for this was unclear. Marks said previous studies of the possible 
impact of early TB vaccinations on allergies had produced conflicting 
results. But the latest study "offers some clues" that it may be possible 
to intervene with the immune system in early life to protect against 
asthma later on, he said. "It may be possible to give a vaccination 
that is specifically designed to reduce the risk of asthma," he said. 
Marks said further research was needed to better understand what it 
was about the TB vaccine that led to the apparent protection. The 
research is published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

CENTRAL IRAQ, April 1 (AFP) - US marines deployed around the south-central 
Iraqi town of Shatra said Tuesday their relations with local civilians 
had sharpy improved as security returned following fierce fighting 
in the past week. About 1,000 marines were still seeking out and engaging 
remnants of Iraqi forces in the region but were encountering little 
significant Iraqi opposition, correspondents on the scene said. "We 
met only light resistance but we still need to provide security," 
said Lieutenant Colonel Peter Owen of the First Regimental Combat 
Team. "It's a lot better than what it was when we first came through 
there," he said, noting that contacts with the local population were 
getting markedly better. "We're seeing that the general consensus 
is that we are 12 years too late and there is a little bit of resentment, 
which is why we haven't seen a popular uprising because last time 
they didn't get support." Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq mounted 
a rebellion against President Saddam Hussein following the 1991 Gulf 
war but failed to get Western, and in particular US, backing. "They 
want to be absolutely sure we are prepared to get rid of the (ruling) 
Baath party before they commit." Owen said marines were also out to 
retrieve the body of one of their own killed in action last week, 
having received a report the body had been buried by a local villager. 
An officer who declined to be identified said: "Iraqi forces are learning 
they can't match us in firepower and they are pulling back and will 
probably attack softer targets." He too reported an improvement in 
ties with local people, recalling that one village elder rode an amphibious 
assault vehicle during a marine charge on the local Baath party headquarters. 
Party members fled and were later killed, prompting waves and cheers 
from the locals, he said. lh/nh/kir Iraq-war-US-Shatra

South Korea's defense ministry flatly denied reports Tuesday that 
North Korea had test-fired a missile into the Yellow Sea. "There was 
no sign that North Korea test-fired a missile today," a ministry spokesman 
told AFP. "That's our ministry's official stance on the issue." South 
Korea issued the denial following a thorough investigation and co-ordination 
with US intelligence, the spokesman said. The denial came some three 
hours after Japan said that North Korea had test-fired an anti-ship 
missile from its western coast earlier Tuesday. North Korea test-fired 
short-range anti-ship missiles on February 24 and March 10 off its 
east coast into the Sea of Japan. "A missile was launched today at 
around 10:15 am (0115 GMT)," a Japanese defense agency spokesman said 
in Tokyo. "But we don't know any more details." Japanese officials 
said the launch site was Hwajinri in Pyongannam province and said 
the missile's range was 60 kilometres (38 miles). The South Korean 
defense ministry spokesman said the Japanese report was apparently 
not based on concrete information. "As far as I know, Japan's military 
authorities had an intelligence report, not what you would describe 
as solid information on the alleged launch," he said. "Based on the 
result of South Korean and US military intelligence authorities' investigation, 
we confirm again there was no missile launch from North Korea today." 
Yonhap news agency cited military analysts here as saying North Korea 
may have test-fired an artillery piece, rather than a missile. jkw/cw/rcw

All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu is to take a four-week break from rugby 
after a flare-up of his chronic kidney problem, New Zealand Rugby 
Union deputy chief executive Steve Tew said Tuesday "Jonah's health 
is paramount and his doctors have recommended that he take a full 
break from rugby so that he can receive the appropriate medical treatment," 
Tew said. Lomu was diagnosed as having nephrotic syndrome, a rare 
and serious kidney disorder, at the end of 1996 and he has been receiving 
regular treatment, including consultations with All Blacks doctor 
John Mayhew. "This is a chronic intermittent condition which has fluctuated 
over the last six or seven years," Mayhew said. "We are hopeful that 
the modifications in his treatment will enable him to return to rugby 
in the near future. We will re-evaluate the situation after four weeks."

Air raid sirens sounded in Kuwait Tuesday before a defence ministry 
spokesman said an Iraqi missile had been shot down over southern Iraq. 
The spokesman told the state KUNA news agency that a Patriot missile 
intercepted the Iraqi missile before it was able to enter Kuwaiti 
airspace. The sirens had wailed for the first time since Saturday, 
only hours after defence forces fired another Patriot missile after 
a monitoring station reported a hostile object in the skies over the 
north of the country. Al-Qabas newspaper Tuesday reported the missile 
fired the night before was a Silkworm which mistakenly hit a fuel 
tank in the Iraqi port city of Umm Qasr, causing a huge explosion. 
Some 18 missiles have been fired at Kuwait since the start of the 
war in neighbouring Iraq, but they have caused relatively little damage. 
Two people were slightly injured early Saturday when a low-flying 
Silkworm missile landed in the sea close to the emirate's largest 
and most popular waterfront shopping mall in the heart of the capital.

New Zealand stocks closed 0.35 percent lower Tuesday as investors 
stayed on the sidelines amid the Iraq war, dealers said. The NZSE50 
index was down 6.84 points to 1,924.77 on turnover of 50.62 million 
dollars (27.45 million US). ABN Amro Craigs retail equities adviser 
Nigel Scott said that with war raging in Iraq and issues like an electricity 
shortage, lower dairy payouts and a softening retail outlook emerging 
locally, investors were sticking to the sidelines. "The broader market 
just started a new financial quarter and you'd have to say the outlook 
hasn't really changed," he said. Telecom shed two cents to 4.50 dollars, 
Auckland International Airport was off seven cents to 5.19 dollars, 
Carter Holt Harvey dipped a cent to 1.77 dollars, Tranz Rail was off 
three cents to 95 cents, The Warehouse eased a cent to 5.57 dollars, 
Contact Energy gained four cents to 4.26 dollars, and Sky City was 
down a cent at 7.89 dollars. Air New Zealand closed a cent higher 
at 49 cents after announcing Monday it was cutting its international 
flights by about three percent due to reduce forward bookings following 
the Iraq war and the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Horizon 
Energy bounced 25 cents to 2.95 dollars on light volume and Powerco 
was four cents higher at 1.42 dollars after the Commerce Commission's 
much-awaited decision on regulating power line companies was released 
Monday. mjf/dv Stocks-NZealand

Sprinter Jodie Henry on Tuesday quit the Australian team for this 
weekend's swimming meet in the United States blaming a fear of flying 
there during the Iraq war. The national team was informed of Henry's 
withdrawal as it prepared to fly out for Indianapolis where it will 
take on a full-strength American team on Sunday. The 19-year-old Commonwealth 
100m freestyle champion left the team camp here after lengthy discussions 
with officials who outlined stringent security precautions late Monday. 
"She (Henry) has shown a genuine fear of flying to the USA in the 
current climate," a team spokesman said on Tuesday. "There were long, 
convoluted discussions and meetings last night with her parents in 
the team camp ... Still this morning we were hopeful she would come 
to the airport but it didn't happen." The team was told of Henry's 
decision at a morning meeting with Australian Swimming high performance 
director Greg Hodge, men's coach Brian Sutton and women's coach Scott 
Volkers. Hodge was confident the late withdrawal would not disrupt 
the team's focus before the clash with the US, the warm-up event for 
July's world championship in Barcelona. "There was some very strong 
resolve and we are ready to see this through," said Hodge. Hodge said 
Henry was still expected to contest the world championships in Spain. 
The team had already been disrupted by the withdrawal of seven key 
members including multi-world champion and record holder Ian Thorpe 
because of injury and illness. Australian Swimming chief executive 
officer Glenn Tasker and security chief Bob Myers addressed a meeting 
of swimmers, coaches and parents on their US plans on the eve of the 
team's departure. rsm/rcw Swim-AUS-USA

The Australian sharemarket was largely unmoved Tuesday by falls in 
global markets, with brokers saying strength in the banking sector 
offset ongoing concerns about the war in Iraq. The SP/ASX 200 index 
closed down 3.0 points or 0.10 percent at 2,882.2, while the All Ordinaries 
index was down 4.4 points at 2,844.2. Market volume was 603.4 million 
shares worth 2.3 billion dollars (1.38 billion US), with 516 stocks 
higher, 433 lower and 290 steady. Shaw Stockbroking dealer Jamie Spiteri 
said the defensive nature of the Australian share market was helping 
steady sentiment, enabling the index to shrug off falls in New York 
and London. "In these uncertain times the money tends to be directed 
towards the more conservative area of the market," Spiteri said. "The 
banks seem to have a fairly solid undertone after experiencing reasonable 
falls in the first two to three months of the year, and Telstra is 
also attracting solid support." NAB jumped 50 cents to 32.45 dollars, 
the Commonwealth rose 28 cents to 26.33 dollars, Westpac closed up 
44 cents at 15.52 dollars and ANZ gained 27 cents to close at 18.20 
dollars. News Corp, which generates 75 percent of its earnings in 
the United States, closed down 14 cents at 10.63 and telecoms giant 
Telstra rose two cents to 4.09 dollars. In resources, Rio Tinto rose

West Indies have called on Brian Lara as skipper to help them deal 
with an expected assault by the world champion Australians. Left-hander 
Lara is back in charge more than three years after he relinquished 
the role. And the 33-year-old is confident his side can compete with 
the Australians, starting on 10 April with the first Test in Georgetown, 
Guyana. "I wouldn't take the job if I didn't think we could win the 
series," said Lara. "We've got a team that is full of a lot of potential. 
"We need to shape our characters against the best team in the world. 
There is no better opposition to do that against." Trinidad-born Lara, 
who holds the world record for the highest Test (375) and first-class 
score (501), has a Test average of 49.49 after 90 Tests. He replaces 
Carl Hooper for the four Tests and seven one-day internationals against 
the World Cup winners, who under Steve Waugh are aiming to return 
to the top of the ICC Test rankings. "I've had two years of introspection, 
two years of looking and seeing where I've gone wrong," Lara said. 
"It was a period of learning. A lot of things I had done two years 
ago, I don't think I'll be doing now. "Definitely it will be a different 
style. It will definitely be Brian Lara you're seeing out there." 
Lara said that other than Carl Hooper and Ridley Jacobs there was 
little experience in the side. "So I think it would be a dereliction 
of duty if I was presented the job and to turn it down. I see my responsibilities 
and I want to play a part." Australian Bennett King takes over as 
coach from Roger Harper, who did not re-apply for the job. King is 
currently in charge of the Australian Academy but is unavailable for 
Australia's visit and Sri Lanka's subsequent tour. His assistant, 
former Test wicketkeeper Gus Logie, will coach the team for those 
matches. Lara has already captained the side in 18 Tests, with a 6-10 
win-loss record, while he also was in charge for 44 one-day internationals 
between March 1997 and January 2000. Lara has played in 90 Tests, 
scoring 7,572 runs - including 16 centuries - while he made a world 
record Test knock of 375 against England in Antigua in May 1994. In 
1998, he was sacked as captain when a players' revolt over pay delayed 
the start of a tour of South Africa but was reinstated four days later 
to end the impasse. During Australia's 1999 tour to the Caribbean, 
Lara led by example, scoring a brilliant 213 in Kingston, which helped 
his side to share the series 2-2. But he gave up the captaincy in 
2000 after West Indies suffered an embarrassing whitewash on a tour 
to New Zealand and replaced by Hooper. The West Indies Cricket Board 
named Ramnaresh Sarwan as vice-captain and added they were appointing 
Bennett King as new team coach subject to inking contractual negotiations. 
Former West Indies fast bowler Colin Croft told the BBC that the West 
Indies had little choice but to plump for Lara for the captaincy with 
few experienced alternatives available. "I think it will go down pretty 
well in the Caribbean. I think he was given the captaincy too early 
the first time. He's better equipped to deal with it now," Croft said. 
The West Indies, World Cup winners in 1975 and 1979, endured a poor 
competition in this year's event. They finished fourth in Pool B in 
South Africa with three wins, two defeats and a rain-ruined no-result 
against Bangladesh which knocked them out of the tournament at the 
first round stage. Australian Test captain Steve Waugh said before 
leaving Sydney he believed the West Indies, led by Lara, were on the 
way to becoming a force again in world cricket. "They went through 
a tough phase for a few years. They've rebounded fairly well and they 
seem to be more together," said Waugh, who has played a world record 
156 Test matches. Australia are fresh from a 4-1 Ashes series victory 
over England and a successful World Cup title defence and are keen 
to reclaim their ranking as the top Test side from South Africa. Australia 
last toured the Caribbean four years ago, Waugh leading the visitors 
to a 2-2 draw in his first series as captain following the retirement 
of Mark Taylor. Lara blasted 546 runs at an average of 91 including 
a highest score of 213 among his three centuries in the series. "He 
was phenomenal last time we were there and, knowing him, he will want 
to play well against the best side in the world, so he'll definitely 
fire up," Waugh said. "They're going to be a lot tougher than people 
give them credit for and we certainly won't be underestimating them."

Belated warning shots may have been the cause of at least 10 civilian 
deaths at a US military checkpoint in Iraq, The Washington Post reported 
Tuesday. "You just (expletive) killed a family because you didn't 
fire a warning shot soon enough," US Army 3rd Division Captain Ronny 
Johnson was heard shouting over the radio to his men after the shooting 
stopped Monday, the daily said. Ten Iraqi civilians, including five 
children, were killed by the 25mm cannon fire, another man was so 
badly injured he was not expected to live, while four other survivors 
escaped largely unhurt, Johnson's company told the Post. Navy Lieutenant 
Commander Charles Owens, a US military spokesman in As-Saliyah, Qatar, 
put the death toll at seven, saying that 13 women and children were 
inside the Iraqi vehicle and that four people escaped unharmed. The 
shooting occurred at a checkpoint at Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) 
south of Baghdad, on Monday afternoon, Owens said, adding that the 
Iraqi vehicle failed to stop despite repeated warning shots fired 
by US troops. The Washington Post said Johnson was in position at 
the intersection when he was heard radioing to one of his forward 
platoons of M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles to stay alert as an unidentified 
four-wheel drive vehicle approached. "Fire a warning shot," Johnson 
told his men as the vehicle kept coming. He followed with another, 
more urgent order to shoot a machine-gun round into the vehicle's 
radiator. "Stop (messing) around," Johnson then yelled at his men 
when he saw no action had been taken, according to the daily. "Finally, 
he shouted at the top of his voice, 'Stop him, Red 1, stop him!'" 
About half a dozen loud reports followed, with Johnson shouting "Cease 
fire," over the radio, the daily said. Johnson's comment that the 
civilian deaths were due to warning shots fired too late, seem to 
be disputed by unnamed US soldiers The Washington Post said "accepted 
the platoon leader's explanation to Johnson over the radio that he 
had, in fact, fired two warning shots, but that the driver failed 
to stop." Lieutenant Owens said an investigation had been opened into 
the shooting. A written statement issued by the US Cental Command 
later said "initial reports indicate the soldiers responded in accordance 
with the rules of engagement to protect themselves." "In light of 
recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised 
considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of life." The 
shooting came as US forces in Iraq were on an increased state of alert 
following a suicide car bombing, also near Najaf, on Saturday that 
killed four US soldiers also from the US Army's 3rd Division. fgf/jlp

Pakistan has demanded evidence from the United States to back allegations 
that it exported nuclear technology to North Korea. "We reject the 
charges made by the American administration," Foreign Minister Khurshid 
Mahmud Kasuri was quoted Tuesday as saying after the United States 
confirmed that it had imposed sanctions on the A.Q.Khan Research Laboratories 
(KRL), a uranium enrichment plant south-east of Islamabad. The sanctions 
-- a two-year trade ban -- were imposed because of KRL's "contributions" 
to efforts by an unnamed foreign body to develop weapons of mass destruction, 
US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington overnight. 
Sanctions have also been slapped on North Korea for exporting missile 
technology, Boucher said. KRL is at the center of months of allegations 
by unnamed US intelligence officials that Pakistan helped North Korea 
develop its controversial nuclear weapons program by providing it 
with designs for uranium-enriching gas centrifuges, in exchange for 
missiles from Pyongyang. Kasuri told The News daily he was seeking 
evidence from the US administration to prove the claims of nuclear 
technology exports. "Our nuclear program is purely for defence and 
we are not involved in any kind of such proliferation," the minister 
was quoted as saying. He rejected suggestions that Pakistan was being 
pressured to curtail its nuclear program, of which KRL is considered 
the hub, and said Pakistan would never bow to any pressure to roll 
back the program. "We would not accept any pressure from any source 
when it comes to meeting our defence needs," Kasuri told reporters. 
The New York Times has reported that a Pakistani aircraft arrived 
in Pyongyang as recently as last July to pick up North Korean missile 
parts -- the payoff in what it said was a "deadly barter" raising 
disturbing questions about US-Pakistan relations. US Secretary of 
State Colin Powell has said he was assured by Pakistan President Pervez 
Musharraf that "there are no further contacts" between Islamabad and 
Pyongyang. But Powell and White House officials have left unanswered 
questions over alleged links in the past. bc/sdm/rcw Pakistan-US-NKorea

Asian sharemarkets and the dollar paused to catch their breath on 
Tuesday following their latest slump but oil prices edged higher as 
worries over the impact of the US-led war in Iraq continued to shake 
confidence. Global share markets and the dollar slumped on Monday 
but regained some balance in Asian trading on Tuesday. However, there 
was nothing to suggest any turnaround in confidence. The US and British 
onslaught on Baghdad continued on Tuesday with a dozen US cruise missiles 
bombarding the Iraqi capital. Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guard 
faced their first significant battle with coalition forces on the 
ground. US forces also shot dead seven women and children after the 
civilian vehicle in which they were traveling failed to stop at a 
military checkpoint in central Iraq. Japanese shares ended the day 
slightly higher after some buying linked to the start of the new Japanese 
financial year. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei 225 closed up 14.01 
points or 0.18 percent at 7,986.72. Kenji Karikomi, general manager 
at Hinode Securities, said fears the US-led war in Iraq would be prolonged 
were still overhanging the market. "If overseas stockmarkets continue 
to fall due to the uncertainty of the duration of the war in Iraq, 
the local stockmarket will also continue to be pressured," he said. 
Many sharemarkets in Asia continued to be rattled by the spread of 
the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The flu-like 
virus has now infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed 
at least 62 people worldwide. In Hong Kong, where 15 people have died, 
authorities are isolating an entire housing block for 10 days in an 
attempt to control the epidemic after about 200 residents were found 
to be infected. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.03 percent to close 
the morning at 8,545.21. "Selling pressure continued in the morning 
amid concerns over the spread of SARS in Hong Kong and the prospects 
of a prolonged war in Iraq," Kim Eng Securities senior sales manager 
Simon Tam said. But Singapore's Straits Times index closed the early 
session up 0.77 percent at 1,277.39 after falling 3.84 percent a day 
earlier. "I think the losses yesterday were a bit overdone and the 
market is now adjusting," DBS Vickers Securities strategist Eddie 
Lee said. Taiwan's weighted index closed up 0.38 percent at 4,337.61 
due to mild bargain hunting after falling 3.48 percent on Monday. 
South Korea's composite index closed up 0.53 percent at 538.56. Wall 
Street's Dow Jones industrials average dropped 153.64 points or 1.89 
percent to 7,992.13 on Monday and the technology-laden Nasdaq index 
declined 28.43 points or 2.08 percent to 1,341.17. "The picture overall 
remains bleak," said Prudential Securities analyst Bryan Piskorowski. 
"Investors struggle with the ongoing travails of war, soft economic 
data and the advent of earnings preannouncement season." A Chicago 
Purchasing Management Association survey showed industrial activity 
in the US Midwest region slumped in March as production took the biggest 
dive in 23 years. The dollar rose against the yen on Tuesday as investors 
all but ignored worsening Japanese business confidence shown in the 
latest Bank of Japan's Tankan survey. The greenback was quoted at 
118.24 yen mid-afternoon, up from 118.15 yen in New York late on Monday. 
The euro was buying 1.0910 dollars, against 1.0902 dollars in New 
York. "Investors ... were more concerned about the possibility of 
a long war in Iraq and its impact on the US economy," said Masato 
Imai, dealer at UFJ Holdings. Oil prices were higher in Asian trading 
amid mounting concerns the ongoing US-led war against Iraq will be 
prolonged, dealers said. The benchmark New York light sweet crude 
contract for May delivery traded at 31.11 dollars a barrel, up seven 
cents from its close of 31.04 in New York on Monday. burs/bro/dv Markets-world

Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on Tuesday reiterated after 
a meeting with US President George W. Bush that the Palestinians had 
to fight "terrorism" before any implementation of a US-backed international 
peace plan. "I said clearly there cannot be two parallel paths: the 
war against terrorism in the day and negotiations at night," Shalom 
told public radio. "The end of terrorism constitutes the central question 
for a return to negotiations with the Palestinians," he said. Shalom, 
who was making his first visit to Washington since being named foreign 
minister last month, met Bush late Monday when the US leader dropped 
in on talks he was holding with US national security advisor Condoleezza 
Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney. He also met with US Secretary 
of State Colin Powell. The roadmap is a plan setting out the steps 
to Palestinian statehood by the year 2005. Based on a Bush speech 
on the Middle East last June, it was drafted by US, UN, EU and Russian 
diplomats, but Israel has raised a number of objections. Foremost 
among its complaints is the fear that the plan might progress from 
one phase to the next without really tackling the problem of powerful 
militant groups attacking Israel. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's advisor 
Dov Weisglass has said he would like a US mechanism to judge when 
the conditions have been met to move from phase to phase, sidelining 
the United Nations and European Union, with whom Israel has cool relations. 
Israel has reportedly proposed 100 changes to the roadmap as drafted, 
and convinced the United States to delay its publication, despite 
European objections, until after its January 28 elections. It has 
since been further delayed as the moderate new Palestinian prime minister, 
Mahmud Abbas, forms his own cabinet, in a move meant to sideline veteran 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, seen by Israel and Washington as 
an obstacle to peace. Israeli public radio reported that during their 
meeting, Bush told Shalom he was "serious" about pressing forward 
with his roadmap. Citing sources in Washington, the radio said the 
US administration did not intend to make any changes to the roadmap 
and that it would be published "as it was". jlr/jh/dab Mideast-Israel-US-roadmap

AS-SALIYAH, Qatar, April 1 (AFP) - US troops killed seven women and 
children at a checkpoint shooting in central Iraq, US officials said 
Tuesday, undermining efforts to win over the Iraqi people and counter 
international concern over the war. The shooting came after a night 
of intense bombardments on Baghdad, where four divisions of President 
Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guard were dug in to defend the 
capital from any ground attack by US and British forces. Saddam's 
main presidential palace complex in the Iraqi capital came under fresh 
bombardment on Tuesday for the second consecutive day, an AFP reporter 
said, with US missiles hitting a major symbol of Saddam's grip on 
power. The palace grounds have been a frequent target in the bombing. 
The checkpoint shooting occurred at Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) 
south of Baghdad on Monday afternoon, Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles 
Owens said at operational heaquarters in Qatar. He said the victims, 
seven women and children, were in a civilian vehicle that failed to 
stop at the military post despite repeated warning shots fired by 
US troops. Four people in the vehicle escaped unharmed. "As a last 
resort, they (US troops) fired into the passenger compartment of the 
vehicle," Owens said, adding that an investigation had been opened. 
"When soldiers opened the vehicle they found 13 women and children 
inside. Seven of the occupants were dead, two were wounded and four 
were unharmed." US forces have been on an increased state of alert 
following a suicide car-bombing, also near Najaf, on Saturday that 
killed four US soldiers. A written statement issued by US Central 
Command said "initial reports indicate the soldiers responded in accordance 
with the rules of engagement to protect themselves." "In light of 
recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised 
considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of life," it 
said. The incident was expected to fuel vocal international opposition 
to the 13-day-old war, which the United States says it is waging with 
a constant eye on keeping civilian casualties to a minimum. Iraqi 
citizens living through nightly bombardments on Baghdad saw the capital 
come under a fresh and intense wave of bombing late Monday. Villagers 
on the edge of the capital reported 20 more civilians dead, 11 of 
them children, from the blitz. AFP reporters said the raids were growing 
more intense and that the barrage late Monday seemed to be the heaviest 
yet to have hit the battered city's downtown area. The ominous whistle 
of the missiles was heard in the sky before a series of explosions 
shook the city, appearing to knock out electricity in entire neighbourhoods. 
Balls of smoke slowly merged into a single cloud overhead. Two missiles 
were seen smashing into Saddam's sprawling presidential compound along 
the banks of the Tigris River, which had aleady been pounded earlier 
Monday. In a television interview with US network ABC, Saudi Foreign 
Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal urged Saddam to step down as a "sacrifice 
for his country." "If his staying in power (is) the only thing that 
brings problems to his country, we expect that he would respond to 
a sacrifice for his country, as he requires any citizen there to," 
he said. South of the capital, US troops massing for a decisive push 
towards Saddam's seat of power reported their first serious fighting 
with Iraq's crack Republican Guard, considered Saddam's most determined 
military unit and key to the defense of Baghdad. US officers said 
200 Iraqis were killed, wounded or captured in the clashes which broke 
out overnight near Karbala, 80 kilometers from Baghdad. Reports of 
the battle around Karbala came as US armoured units finalised plans 
for a decisive thrust toward Baghdad within a week, commanders said, 
with forces concentrated near Najaf, to the south. The US army's elite 
101st Airborne Division clashed with Iraqi forces near the town, with 
Apache and Kiowa Warrior helicopters backing ground troops and striking 
military targets in and around the Shiite Muslim holy city. US President 
George W. Bush said the day of victory was drawing closer. "Many dangers 
lie ahead, but day by day we are moving closer to Baghdad. Day by 
day, we are moving closer to victory," he said at a ceremony in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania. In Basra, seen as key to controling southeast Iraq, 
British troops said they were waiting for reinforcements before making 
a final push to take the city. British commanders said 600 soldiers 
backed by tanks and armoured vehicles were battling to punch through 
the town of Abu Al Khasib, 20 kilometers to the southeast of Basra, 
as British artillery pounded Basra's western edge. An Iraqi military 
spokesman said at least 54 US and British soldiers had been killed 
in fighting since Sunday, most of them around Basra, with an unspecified 
number of others killed in other parts of Iraq. Officials in London 
said a British soldier was killed on duty in southern Iraq, taking 
to 26 the British death toll since the start of the war. US authorities 
say at least 39 US soldiers have been killed. Iraqi Foreign Minister 
Naji Sabri said that some 5,000 Arab volunteers were ready to commit 
suicide attacks against coalition troops. But US General Vincent Brooks 
dismissed the threats, telling reporters at the US Central Command's 
forward base in Qatar: "It's not a very effective military tactic 
at all. It's a terror tactic and it won't be effective." burs-jah/yad

Australia reported its first suspected case of a deadly respiratory 
virus on Tuesday and Hong Kong considered setting up camps to quarantine 
victims of the disease which has sparked a global health crisis. France 
joined the list of countries advising against travel to Asian nations 
affected by the outbreak of atypical pneumonia, also known as Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and screening travellers. Livestock 
in southern China were cited on Tuesday as a possible cause of the 
virus that has killed 62 people so far -- 34 in China, 15 in Hong 
Kong, four in Vietnam, four in Canada, four in Singapore and one in 
Thailand. Frustration was growing meanwhile with China for its handling 
of the SARS outbreak, which began in southern China in November, spread 
to Hong Kong in February and from there to three continents through 
airline passengers. In Australia, health officials said a man recently 
returned from Singapore had become the country's first likely SARS 
case but had made a full recovery after being admitted to a Sydney 
hospital. "We still cannot be sure this person had SARS but in the 
absence of other diagnosis, we thought it would be prudent to alert 
the WHO (World Health Organisation) to this unusual case," said chief 
medical officer Richard Smallwood. "That one case is all we've seen 
but it hasn't spread in Australia," he stressed. France, where four 
SARS cases have been reported, became the latest country to advise 
against travel to Hong Kong and regions of China and announced it 
would begin screening travellers from SARS-affected countries. In 
Hong Kong, where 15 people have died of SARS and more than 600 have 
been infected, the authorities said they were looking into the possibility 
of using government holiday camps as quarantine centres. The Hong 
Kong authorities have already taken the extraordinary step of isolating 
an entire housing block for 10 days in an attempt to control the epidemic 
around 200 residents were found to be infected. Hong Kong and Singapore 
have also closed all primary and secondary schools in a bid to stem 
the outbreak. Singapore has put more than 800 households under mandatory 
home quarantine for 10 days and put 600,000 school children on holiday 
until April 6. The Wall Street Journal urged the world to sever all 
travel links to China for the "grossly negligent" way it has handled 
the outbreak. "Given Beijing's refusal to take even elementary public 
health measures, some hard choices are called for," the US newspaper 
said. "The most effective way to halt the spread of the disease would 
be for other countries to suspend all travel links with China until 
it has implemented a transparent public health campaign." The WHO 
has been more restrained with the Chinese authorities but a WHO expert 
currently in Beijing awaiting permission to travel to Guangdong province, 
the epicentre of the outbreak, betrayed some annoyance on Tuesday. 
"China needs to get up to speed with the international effort to map 
the spread of this disease," said Dr. James Maguire. "During a global 
epidemic all players need to participate, if a major player chooses 
not to, this could be very problematic," he told AFP. A source close 
to the WHO said on Tuesday that the Geneva-based health body was "working 
on a theory that the virus has its source in farm animals in southern 
China". Peter Cordingley, the spokesman for the Manila-based Western 
Pacific WHO regional office, said: "At this stage, we are not saying 
this is the cause but it is certainly something we are looking into 
in the general scheme of things." Hitoshi Oshitani, a Manila-based 
WHO expert on communicable diseases, said viruses of many emerging 
diseases were known to have come from animals by "crossing species 
barriers". Oshitani said SARS was the "most significant outbreak of 
a disease through air travel in history". bur/cl/pch Health-pneumonia

Australian military experts at war over progress of Iraq conflict 
by Jack Taylor ATTENTION - RECASTS /// SYDNEY, April 1 (AFP) - Australian 
military chiefs backed US claims Tuesday that the Iraq war is progressing 
well and according to schedule despite claims by analysts that the 
battle for Iraqi hearts and minds has been been lost. Armed forces 
chief, General Peter Cosgrove, said carefully prepared plans for the 
war had always recognised the nature and size of the task, in which 
2,000 Australians are the third force in the US-led coalition. "It's 
clear from were I stand that, notwithstanding some of the unexpected 
and unusual events that have occurred, the war is right on its timeline 
and well within the success parameters that the plan envisaged," Cosgrove 
told reporters. "After less than two weeks large sections of Iraq 
are under coalition control and the Iraqi army has been severely weakened. 
The regime has been hit precisely and hard. "The south of the country 
will be progressively secured and cleared of Iraqi forces of all types 
over the coming days and weeks." The successes, he said, would allow 
further humanitarian relief to flow and the liberation of the Iraqi 
people to begin, setting the stage for the "decisive defeat of a regime 
that harbours weapons of mass destruction." Cosgrove, a popular and 
trusted figure in Australia after leading its successful military 
intervention in East Timor in 1999, blamed the media for helping obscure 
what he called "the bigger picture". While correspondents had given 
the public an unprecedented view of the war, their inevitable focus 
had been on detail -- "a skirmish here and a battle there" "My view 
is that the bigger picture is one of dramatic success and a plan on 
time in achieving the goals it set for itself," he said. But some 
of Australia's leading defence experts painted a different and grim 
picture of the political consequences of the war. Alan Dupont, of 
the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre of Canberra's Australian 
National University (ANU), said the coalition is losing the battle 
for Iraq hearts and minds although it may be regaining the military 
advantage. He described the deaths of seven women and children shot 
by US troops when their vehicle failed to stop at a checkpoint as 
a public relations disaster. His ANU colleague, professor Des Ball, 
said the coalition partners had probably already lost the political 
war. "Saddam and his regime will go but the coalition's other war 
aims, I believe, are in tatters," he said. Their assessment coincided 
with two new polls showing growing public support in Australia for 
the war. A poll for The Sydney Morning Herald showed 44 percent support, 
up sharply from six percent in January, while opposition to it had 
almost halved to 48 percent from 92 percent in January. A poll for 
The Australian newspaper, found 51 percent support, up six points 
since the war began. Cosgrove admitted to being disappointed but not 
surprised that weapons of mass destruction had not been found so far, 
but said this meant only that further work had to be done to find 
them. He said there had been a few surprises such as the use of human 
shields and the fact that Iraq troops had been wearing civilian clothes, 
mingling with civilians and firing on coalition forces. "That is a 
terrorist act under any definition," he said. He said the war had 
so far been a great success for a force that was relatively small 
compared to the 1991 Gulf war coalition, and it had achieved its successes 
with a concern to avoid civilian casualties and damage that was unique 
in war. jt/rcw Iraq-war-Australia

Hundreds of residents isolated after the outbreak of a deadly respiratory 
illness in a Hong Kong residential complex may be removed to a government 
quarantine centre, a legislator said Tuesday. Democratic Party lawmaker 
Li Wah-ming said the government would remove all residents to a quarantine 
centre if the outbreak at the 33-story Amoy Gardens residential complex 
was not soon brought under control. "A quarantine centre has been 
already been prepared," Li told reporters after meeting with director 
of health Margaret Chan and flat owners from the Amoy Gardens complex 
located on Kowloon peninsula. Four holiday camps under the management 
of the government's Leisure and Cultural Service Department, with 
a combined capacity of 1,050 people, are reportedly being considered. 
Chan was not immediately available for further comment Tuesday, but 
it appeared the administration was preparing for an all out assault 
on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic which has 
so far killed 15 in Hong Kong and infected at least another 610. The 
revised death toll was announced after authorities on Monday took 
the extraordinary step of ordering a 264-unit block of the Amoy Gardens 
housing complex isolated until midnight April 9. But a health department 
spokeswoman told AFP Tuesday there were only some 240 residents in 
108 units when the quarantine order was put in place, and that authorities 
had little information on the whereabouts of tenants from another 
156 units who have reportedly fled. Health chief Yeoh Eng-kiong told 
reporters Monday that investigations by Hong Kong University had discovered 
the virus could be detected in the faeces of patients. He said the 
authorities were studying if the Amoy Gardens outbreak was related 
to a waste water mains at the estate which had recently burst. The 
public housing estate was sealed late Monday by around 50 police officers 
wearing white masks who set up barricades around the buildings. Health 
workers also set up a temporary clinic to monitor health and the authorities 
will supply isolated residents with food until the quarantine order 
is lifted. The measure was taken after 185 residents in the block 
came down with the flu-like symptoms of SARS, including 64 who were 
diagnosed on Monday. During the isolation period, no one will be allowed 
to enter or leave the premises without the express permission of a 
health officer. Anybody who violated the isolation order would face 
a fine of 5,000 Hong Kong dollars (850 US) and six months in jail. 
A quarantine law invoked by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa last Thursday 
as part of tougher measures to contain the virus, which included the 
closure of all schools until April 6, also took effect on Monday. 
Hong Kong authorities have meanwhile called on passengers who travelled 
on Thai Airways flight TG 606 from Bangkok to Hong Kong on March 29 
to contact the territory's health department. The call follows the 
admission of a passenger on that flight to Princess Margaret Hospital 
with suspected SARS soon after his arrival in Hong Kong. The mysterious 
illness has now infected more than 1,700 people in 15 countries. According 
to a tally compiled by AFP, the worldwide death toll from SARS stands 
at 62, with 34 deaths in China, 15 in Hong Kong, four in Vietnam, 
four in Canada, four in Singapore and one in Thailand. hw/pch Health-pneumonia-HongKong-quarantine

A repeat meeting of top-level negotiators who launched an historic 
China-Taiwan dialogue here 10 years ago has been deferred due to fears 
of a killer respiratory virus, organisers said Tuesday. The East Asian 
Institute of the National University of Singapore did not give a new 
date for the meeting, which was originally scheduled for April 7. 
It was supposed to be the first reunion between Koo Chen-foo of Taiwan 
and China's Wang Daohan since their historic talks in Singapore in 
1993. "It is with much regret that I have to inform you that we have 
decided to postpone the conference on grounds that Singapore is one 
of the areas stricken with the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS)," said institute director professor Wang Gungwu. "This 
is a difficult decision that we have to take to safeguard the interest 
of our speakers and attendees at the conference," Wang said in a letter 
to AFP. The meeting will be rescheduled at a later date when the situation 
has improved in Singapore, he said. At least four people have died 
of SARS in Singapore, with 92 cases reported. The mysterious illness, 
which manifests itself as an unusual form of pneumonia, has now infected 
some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed at least 62. Koo, chairman 
of Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Wang, 
from the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, first 
met in a landmark dialogue here from April 27-29, 1993. Now octogenarians, 
the two represented the two rivals separated in 1949 at the end of 
a civil war. Beijing has suspended since 1995 a second dialogue between 
the two elders, angered by a high-profile visit to the United States 
by then Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui. Academics from the mainland, 
Taiwan and the United States have also been invited to present papers 
at the proposed reunion conference in Singapore, a predominantly ethnic 
Chinese city-state with strong ties to both Beijing and Taipei. mba/rc/cl

Red tape, face-saving measures and institutional incompetence are 
most likely behind China's refusal to face up to the outbreak of a 
deadly respiratory disease, experts said Tuesday. Under international 
criticism, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) 
issued its first bulletin on atypcial pneumonia since March 26 urging 
all health departments to take effective measures to control the disease 
that has killed at least 62 people worldwide. Doctors were also urged 
to report to their provincial disease control centers any patients 
showing symptoms of atypical pneumonia, guidelines on the CDCP's website 
said. A team of World Health Organization experts was Tuesday also 
awaiting Beijing's permission to travel to southern Guangdong province 
where they believe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) first 
broke out last November. China has been the country worst hit by the 
mysterious virus, which has left 34 dead and more than 800 infected. 
Most SARS figures came from a report by Guangdong province that only 
went up to March 1. Fifteen people have died and more than 600 have 
been infected in neighboring Hong Kong after a doctor from Guangdong 
brought the illness into the territory. The WHO experts were reportedly 
seeking to investigate whether or not farm animals in southern China 
were the source of the virus. "China needs to get up to speed with 
the international effort to map the spread of this disease," said 
Dr. James Maguire, a WHO expert currently in Beijing awaiting permission 
to go to Guangdong. "During a global epidemic all players need to 
participate, if a major player chooses not to, this could be very 
problematic," he told AFP. The team of five WHO experts was also waiting 
for China to fulfill its promise of providing daily provincial reports 
updating the progress of the disease nationwide, but so far such reports 
have not been forthcoming. "We are hoping to get updated information, 
but China has a system that is not exactly set up for this type of 
thing, so changes to the system is what is needed, as soon as possible." 
Political considerations and "red tape" were also slowing down China's 
responsiveness, he said. "This is an institutionalized problem, health 
officials are just not used to reporting because the spread of disease 
in China has always been secretive," said Hu Jia, director of the 
Beijing-based Aizhi Institute, a non-governmental AIDS awareness group. 
"I think it is pretty clear, the government does not want to see China 
as the center of transmission of atypical pneumonia," Hu told AFP. 
Other considerations were obviously involved, Hu said, like China's 
foreign trade, dependence on foreign investment and a booming tourist 
industry. "If they want to maintain foreign trade, continue to attract 
foreign investment and put on an Olympic Games, then China needs to 
have a world class public health system," an international health 
worker in Beijing said. "I think they recognize this, but in China 
change has never come easily," he said on condition of anonymity. 
Meanwhile, the state-run press failed to carry any new updates on 
the spread of the disease in the country on Tuesday, as more international 
events scheduled to be held in China were cancelled. Following the 
cancelation of two Rolling Stones concerts in Shanghai and Beijing 
on Saturday and several sporting events last week, the World Economic 
Forum (WEF) announced Tuesday it would postpone its annual China Business 
Summit due to the epidemic. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal blasted 
China's silence as a "cover-up," and urged the world to cut all travel 
links to China for the "grossly negligent" way it has handled the 
epidemic. "The most effective way to halt the spread of the disease 
would be for other countries to suspend all travel links with China 
until it has implemented a transparent public health campaign," the 
paper said. sai/ph/sdm/pch Health-pneumonia-China

France's Societe Generale Group Tuesday said it would establish this 
week a joint venture fund management with Chinese steel conglomerate 
Shanghai Baosteel Group. The joint venture unites Societe Generale's 
fund management group, SG Asset Management Co. (SG AM), and Baosteel's 
Fortune Trust and Investment Co. in a deal that was officially approved 
last October. SG AM Management Co., will own 33 percent of the new 
company headquartered in the eastern city of Shanghai, which plans 
to begin doing business with a registered capital of 100 million yuan 
(12 million US dollars). But before Fortune SG AM begins trading its 
umbrella fund it will seek to raise three billion yuan in capital, 
the company said. Sino-foreign fund management joint ventures approved 
in recent weeks, hope to draw on the more than one trillion dollars 
in China's household savings, largely ildling in domestic banks at 
annual interest rates of 1.98 percent. Last month ING Group's fund 
management arm, ING Investment Management and China Merchants Fund 
Management became the mainland's first group to launch open-ended 
umbrella funds, including a bond fund, an equity fund, and a fund 
made up of both financial instruments. Another foreign company that 
has established a fund management joint venture is fellow Dutch financial 
group and rival ABN Amro. Allianz, Invesco and Fortis are awaiting 
final approval to launch their own funds. bms/dv China-SocietyGenerale-France-company-fund

Crack US troops unnerved by Iraqis firing from ambulance, garbage 
truck by Tim Sloan = (PICTURE) = ATTENTION - ADDS location /// SOUTHERN 
IRAQ, April 1 (AFP) - Paratrooper Zach Talraas nursed his wounds on 
a hospital bed and shook his head at how Iraqi troops firing from 
a garbage truck and an ambulance could face down the the US army's 
elite 82nd Airborne Division. "It makes the job a lot tougher. You 
have to take a second or half a second before you can start firing 
in reference to determining if a target is hostile or friendly like 
the ambulance," the private from Delta 325 Company said. The 82nd 
Airborne is one of the United States' most celebrated and battle-tested 
units but it was clearly caught off guard by the unconventional Iraqi 
tactics. The firefight around the town of Samawah left several wounded, 
at least two seriously, and men like Talraas unnerved. "Saddam's whole 
thing is to make us look like the bad guys in reference to having 
to fight against guerilla tactics and people using ambulances as cover," 
he said. The platoon had been tasked with securing two bridges in 
the city. Taking the first bridge "was almost too easy", said Talraas, 
but the next part of the mission was anything but. US troops driving 
in humvees first came under fire from civilian vehicles, hitting back 
with 50 caliber rounds and Mark 19 grenade launchers. They were again 
taken by surprise when a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) was fired 
at them from a garbage truck, said Talraas. "A man hiding in a dumpster 
fired an RPG at one of the humvees. Several soldiers received small 
shrapnel wounds but were able to continue fighting. The dumpster was 
destroyed with return fire," he said. The respite was brief however 
as a white ambulance with red flashing lights crossed the bridge and 
headed straight for the US troops before its occupants also opened 
fire. US troops returned fire and the ambulance retreated but they 
were then were pinned down by sniper fire for the better part of an 
hour before a decision was made to break contact, pull back and regroup. 
Talraas tried to take cover behind his gun turret on the humvee but 
was injured in the shooting. His driver was shot in the hand. "My 
driver screamed and then I felt myself get shot," said Talraas. "It 
was pretty scary. It reminded me of a scene from (the Vietnam war 
movie) Full Metal Jacket." Talraas stayed in his gun turret "to lay 
down suppressive fire as we had another platoon on foot next to the 
humvee and couldn't just leave them". The shooting eventually died 
down and the soldiers were able to retreat. But Talraas said the incident 
had highlighted that the rules of combat in Iraq are anything but 
black and white. "All the combatants were in civilian clothing and 
not using any military vehicles," he said. Talraas was being treated 
at an Iraqi air base captured by coalition forces. One of the casualties 
has been flown out of Iraq. ts-co/dab Iraq-war-ambulance

Hong Kong's companies are doing all they can to keep the corporate 
wheels turning despite a deadly virus outbreak, including having staff 
work from home and opening back-up offices away from infected sites. 
Hong Kong is the centre of the global outbreak severe acute respiratory 
sydndrome (SARS), which has now infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries 
and killed at least 62. After breaking out in neighbouring Guangdong 
province in southern China, the virus spread to Hong Kong, where 15 
people have died and at least 610 have been infected. In most offices 
business is continuing as usual, despite the wide adoption of surgical 
masks, which make many workplaces look more like hospital wards. But 
some firms have had to adopt innovative measures to ensure their staff 
and businesses remain healthy. Global banking giant HSBC has told 
50 of its staff in its capital markets and treasury department to 
work from home for a week, while another worksite is prepared for 
them. An HSBC teller was diagnosed with SARS last week. Vinh Tram, 
spokeswoman for HSBC Holdings plc, said the priority was to ensure 
operations could continue without interruption. "We have contingency 
plans in case of emergency, including creating a backup team," she 
said. Other firms have also had to arrange for staff to work from 
home after one of their workers has been found to be suffering from 
the virus. Dao Heng Bank, owned by Singapore-based DBS Group Holdings, 
said a staff member based in its customer centre has been diagnosed 
with SARS. Medical check-ups have been arranged for all staff members 
who may have been in contact with the employee and they have been 
told to stay at home in the meantime, spokeswoman Angel Lin said. 
"We have a back-up team to ensure minimal disruption to operations," 
said Lin. In common with many other companies, Dao Heng's parent DBS 
Group has suspended all business travel for its employees to minimise 
exposure to SARS. For many businesses, a downturn is inevitable as 
a result of the outbreak. Many shops and restaurants are suffering 
a slump as many people try to avoid public places as much as possible. 
The Grand Hyatt Hotel in has decided to suspend all buffet meal operations 
at its restaurants. "The well-being of our guests and employees is 
always of paramount concern," hotel spokeswoman Vivian Wan said. A 
sudden eruption of cases at the Amoy Gardens estate in Kowloon district 
prompted the Hong Kong authorities to take the unprecedented measure 
of ordering the complete isolation of the housing block on Monday. 
A total of around 200 cases have been uncovered at Amoy Gardens, and 
several local businesses have also had to close. As a precautionary 
measures, Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. has decided to close down 
a branch in the Amoy Gardens complex. "This is just a precautionary 
measure," said spokeswoman Angel Yip. "We have emergency measures 
in different departments in case any staff fall ill to the disease, 
in order to keep business going on," said Yip. Irene Chan, spokeswoman 
for Walt Disney's Hong Kong operations, said some staff have been 
allowed to take leave to look after their children after local schools 
were closed to contain the spread of the virus. There have been reports 
that some expatriate workers have sent their families home but Chan 
said Disney's foreign staff continued to report to work. "At the moment, 
no expatriate staff have asked to return home," said Chan. pl/bro

Business confidence falls in Bank of Japan's Tankan survey by Jonathan 
Annells ATTENTION - ADDS small companies' outlook, analyst's comment, 
UPDATES stocks close /// TOKYO, April 1 (AFP) - The Bank of Japan 
(BoJ) said Tuesday its latest Tankan survey showed business confidence 
had fallen in the past three months and economists warned the full 
impact of the war in Iraq was still to be felt. The large manufacturers' 
index slipped one point to minus 10, although the index of large non-manufacturers 
improved slightly to minus 14 from minus 16, the central bank said 
in its January-March survey. The indices measure the difference between 
firms saying economic conditions are favorable and those saying they 
are unfavorable. A negative figure means a majority of firms see economic 
conditions as unfavorable. It was the first downturn in the confidence 
index for large manufacturers since the three months to December 2001. 
Economists had predicted a slight improvement, with the forecast for 
large manufacturers seen at minus eight. They were also wrong-footed 
by the large non-manufacturers' index, which was forecast to come 
in at minus 17. Capital expenditure by all non-financial companies 
in the financial year to March just ended was seen falling by 6.6 
percent, compared with the 4.8 percent decline shown in the December 
Tankan. "The survey overall showed the economy was levelling off. 
What is alarming is that an improvement among large manufacturers, 
who had led the recent recovery of business confidence, has come to 
a halt," said Toshio Sumitani, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Centre. 
Sumitani said the signs of improvement in the economy had waned and 
the impact of the US-led war in Iraq was still to be fully factored 
in. "The survey this time might include negative impacts from the 
war to a certain extent amid the fears of a looming military strike, 
but I do not think companies polled expected the war could drag on 
like this." A BoJ spokesman said about 90 percent of companies surveyed 
had responded before the outbreak of war. Despite the weakening in 
large manufacturers' sentiment, the number of companies that believe 
they have excess capacity declined, and fewer large firms said they 
felt they had excessive inventories or staff, the central bank survey 
found. "This time around it's very noticeable that all the measures 
of the state of the economy improved, yet the large manufacturers' 
sentiment went down, which tells you that a non-economic factor came 
in somewhere," said Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING. "The problems 
with Iraq and North Korea did hurt sentiment," he said, referring 
to the nuclear stand-off on the Korean peninsula. Looking ahead, both 
major sectors surveyed said they saw an improvement in the three months 
to June, according to the central bank. Business sentiment for large 
manufacturers is forecast to improve to minus eight in the June Tankan 
and the large non-manufacturers is seen at minus 13. "What struck 
me as a surprise was both sectors' sentiment improved (for the June 
quarter)... companies are not so pessimistic about the future," said 
Teruo Ikeda, economist at UFJ Institute. Conditions at small firms 
look set to worsen over the next quarter, however, according to the 
survey. Daiwa Institute of Research senior economist Junichi Makino 
said protracted military action in Iraq may pose serious a downside 
risk for corporate activity. "The respondents apparently did not take 
into account the risk of prolonged military action in Iraq in the 
latest survey, as such a view began to emerge just recently," Makino 
said. The survey was virtually ignored in the foreign exchange and 
equity markets. Dealers said investors were also more worried about 
a protracted US-led war against Iraq. Tokyo share prices closed up 
0.18 percent after opening lower. As a detailed study of Japanese 
businesses and their plans for the months ahead, the quarterly Tankan 
survey is the central bank's key source of data for planning. bur-ja/dv

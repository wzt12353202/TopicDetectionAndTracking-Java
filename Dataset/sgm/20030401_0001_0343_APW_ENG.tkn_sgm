A man claiming to be armed with two grenades tried to hijack a passenger 
plane from Cuba's Isle of Youth to the United States late Monday, 
but the plane was forced to land in Havana because of insufficient 
fuel. Authorities said they were negotiating early Tuesday to end 
a standoff with the man, who remained on the plane, along with 46 
other people, on a remote tarmac at the Havana airport. ^ MORE &lt;

An American warplane veered off the USS Constellation's flight deck 
and slipped into the water during landing Tuesday. The two pilots 
ejected and were rescued by helicopter in the Persian Gulf. The S-3B 
Viking airplane, which is generally used for anti-submarine warfare, 
malfunctioned, military officials said in a statement. After being 
rescued, both pilots were able to walk off the helicopter, although 
one was carried away on a stretcher. Both were being evaluated for 
minor injuries, officials said. Their names were not released.

The Boston Bruins qualified for the NHL playoffs Monday when Steve 
Shields made a key save in overtime to preserve a 2-2 tie with the 
Tampa Bay Lightning. Dan Boyle took a shot from point-blank range 
with 25 seconds remaining, but Shields stopped it with his pads. Coupled 
with the New York Rangers' overtime loss, the Bruins clinched an Eastern 
Conference playoff berth. The Lightning wrapped up no worse than the 
sixth seed in the East. Tampa Bay's John Grahame held off the Bruins 
despite the Lightning being outshot 19-4 in the third period and overtime 
Tampa Bay extended its franchise-record unbeaten streak to 6-0-6 and 
is 13-2-8 in its last 23 games. But its long winless string in Boston 
continued. The Lightning are 0-14-4 there since their last victory 
_ Dec. 17, 1997. Overall, they're 1-15-5 in Boston. Mike Knuble and 
Nick Boynton scored for Boston. Ruslan Fedotenko and Fredrik Modin 
had goals for Tampa Bay. &lt; ^ Thrashers 4, Rangers 3, OT = In New 
York, Yannick Tremblay scored a power-play goal at 2:40 of overtime 
to give Atlanta a win over New York. Marc Savard had a pair of goals 
and added an assist for Atlanta, while Dany Heatley assisted on three 
goals _ including the game-winner. Eric Lindros was off for high-sticking 
when Tremblay scored. The Rangers trail the idle New York Islanders 
by three points with three games to play in the race for the final 
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The teams play Tuesday night 
on Long Island, and an Islanders victory would eliminate the Rangers 
from playoff contention. Mark Messier, Petr Nedved and Boris Mironov 
scored for the Rangers. Vyachaslev Kozlov had the other Atlanta goal. 
&lt; ^ Flyers 6, Penguins 1 = In Pittsburgh, Keith Primeau scored 
once and set up two goals in just over eight minutes of the second 
period as Philadelphia beat Pittsburgh for the fourth time in 17 days. 
The Penguins' Jamie Pushor scored the opening goal in the first period, 
but Flyers goaltender Roman Cechmanek had little difficulty thereafter. 
The Penguins are winless in 10 games at home (0-9-1), one short of 
the club record. They are 1-16-2 overall in their last 19. John LeClair, 
Michal Handzus, Sami Kapanen, Radovan Somik and Marty Murray also 
scored for the Flyers, who moved within two points of idle New Jersey 
for the Atlantic Division lead. &lt; ^ Red Wings 3, Predators 0 = 
In Detroit, Curtis Joseph earned his 41st career shutout, and Sergei 
Fedorov had a goal and an assist as Detroit beat Washington to win 
its third straight Central Division title. Joseph stopped 27 shots 
for his fifth shutout of the season. Steve Yzerman and Henrik Zetterberg 
also scored for the Red Wings, who have 106 points. It was only the 
second goal for Yzerman since his return in late February from offseason 
knee surgery. &lt; ^ Canadiens 4, Hurricanes 0 = In Raleigh, North 
Carolina, backup goaltender Mathieu Garon got his second shutout in 
seven games, stopping 33 shots as Montreal beat Carolina to snap a 
three-game losing streak. Saku Koivu, Francis Bouillon and Richard 
Zednik scored first-period goals for the Canadiens. Donald Audette 
closed out the scoring in the second period. &lt; ^ Wild 3, Flames 
0 = In St. Paul, Minnesota, Manny Fernandez earned his eighth career 
shutout with 26 saves as Minnesota blanked Calgary. Cliff Ronning, 
Pierre-Marc Bouchard and Antti Laaksonen scored for Minnesota, which 
had three power-play goals for the first time this season. Fernandez, 
who notched his second shutout of the season, and Dwayne Roloson have 
a combined six. &lt; ^ Stars 3, Sabres 0 = In Dallas, Marty Turco 
made 18 saves for his sixth shutout of the season as the Dallas beat 
Buffalo to move into a tie for the NHL's best record. The Pacific 
Division-champion Stars have 107 points, one more than Detroit in 
the race for home ice throughout the Western Conference playoffs. 
Dallas pulled even with Eastern Conference leader Ottawa in the race 
for the NHL's top record. Dallas, 5-0-0-2 in its last seven games, 
got goals from Richard Matvichuk, Brenden Morrow and Rob DiMaio. &lt; 
^ Blues 5, Oilers 5 = In St. Louis, Ethan Moreau scored Edmonton's 
third goal of the third period with 1:52 remaining in regulation as 
the Oilers rallied for a tie with St. Louis. It was the second big 
comeback in two days for the Oilers, who came back from a 4-1 deficit 
on Sunday to tie Chicago 4-4. The Blues had already lost out on a 
chance to win the Central Division when Detroit beat Nashville earlier 
Monday to clinch the title. Pavol Demitra and Scott Mellanby each 
had a goal and two assists for the Blues, who were 25-2-1-3 when leading 
after two periods. In overtime, each team had two shots. St. Louis' 
Chris Osgood has given up 11 goals in his last two games. ^ MORE

North Korea test-fired a ground-to-ship missile Tuesday, Japanese 
officials said, just days after Tokyo launched its first spy satellites 
into orbit to keep watch over Pyongyang's missile and suspected nuclear 
arms programs. Japan's launch angered the communist state and it threatened 
to test-fire a missile. Its decision to do so Tuesday has added to 
growing fears here that the reclusive state may take advantage of 
the war in Iraq to escalate its missile and nuclear programs. The 
short-range missile, with a range of about 60 kilometers (37 miles), 
was fired from the northwestern coast of the Korean Peninsula, Japanese 
defense agency and transport ministry officials said. North Korea 
fired a long-range missile that flew over Japan and plunged into the 
Pacific Ocean in 1998. It is believed to possess missiles that may 
reach parts of the United States. North Korea test-fired two short-range 
missiles in late February and early March amid tensions over its suspected 
nuclear weapons programs. Washington and South Korea have criticized 
the tests as attempts to force the United States into direct talks. 
With the United States focused on the war in Iraq, some experts say 
North Korea might exploit the opportunity to test long-range missiles 
or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make atomic bombs. Defense Agency 
spokesman Manabu Shimamoto denied that Tuesday's missile was a direct 
threat to Japan and that it appeared to be aimed away from Japan. 
The agency is still checking into details such as where it fell, he 
said. ``We believe it is a ground-to-ship missile that is impossible 
to reach Japan,'' Shimamoto said. The Korean nuclear crisis flared 
in October last year, when U.S. officials said Pyongyang admitted 
having a nuclear program. Washington and its allies suspended fuel 
shipments, and the North retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, withdrawing 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting a nuclear 
reactor.

Coalition aircraft have bombed a complex that serves as the office 
the Iraqi National Olympic Committee and, according to critics of 
the Iraqi president, a torture center run by Saddam Hussein's eldest 
son, Udai, the U.S. military said Tuesday. ``Coalition aircraft used 
precision-guided munitions to target a regime office complex in eastern 
Baghdad,'' a U.S. Central Command statement said. The attack on the 
office of the Olympic Committee, which Udai heads, occurred at 10:30 
p.m. local time Monday. ``The strike was executed to erode the command 
and control capabilities of regime leaders,'' the statement added. 
Centcom said the complex also housed Iraq's Ministry of Youth. The 
extent of damage was still being assessed. Critics of the Saddam have 
campaigned to have Iraq thrown out of the International Olympic Movement 
because of widespread allegations that Udai Saddam Hussein had tortured 
his own country's athletes and used the Olympic center as a site for 
torturing both athletes and others. Iraq had repeatedly denied such 
allegations. In January, an official of the International Olympic 
Committee said it was investigating these allegations. Last year, 
the London-based human rights group Indict demanded that the IOC expel 
the Iraqi Olympic Committee from its ranks. Citing witness statements 
by exiled Iraqi athletes and United Nations reports, Indict claimed 
Udai, once made a group of track athletes crawl on newly poured asphalt 
while they were beaten, and ordered that some be thrown off a bridge. 
The group also alleged Udai ran a special prison for sportsmen who 
offended him.

A swath of southern Iraq has been called many things: Land of the 
swamp people. Mother of all untapped oil reserves. Scene of the worst 
environmental crime in history. Cradle of civilization. Saddam's slaughterhouse. 
At the moment, it is a 21st century battlefield. But the great expanse 
known to scientists as the Mesopotamia Marshlands figures to be one 
of keys to what will become of postwar Iraq. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein 
purportedly drained these wetlands _ satellite images show only 7 
percent of the fragile ecosystem still intact _ as part of his campaign 
to crush Shiite Muslims who rebelled against him in 1991. Geologists 
believe fabulous sources of untapped oil percolate beneath sections 
of this expanse, which was half the size of Switzerland little more 
than a decade ago. Yet some environmental engineers advocate reflooding 
the region to restore the habitat, the surviving fraction of which 
still harbors the vestiges of rare birds, fish and what remains of 
a 5,000-year-old subculture known as the Marsh Arabs, people who live 
on floating islands handmade from enormous reeds. In an arid, windblown 
region where oil means wealth but water means survival, dueling forces 
stand ready to shape the fate of the Fertile Crescent that provided 
the right ingredients to spawn Mesopotamia, the first civilization. 
``The marshes happen to be on top of the some of the greatest untapped 
reserves of oil,'' said Mark Bartolini, Middle East director for the 
International Rescue Committee. ``Are we going to flood the marshes 
for the people who lived there for millennia?'' The relief organization 
has targeted for aid the roughly 200,000 Iraqi Shiites living as refugees 
in neighboring Iran. Most fled in the wake of Saddam's defeat in the 
1991 Persian Gulf War, after which Shiites in southern Iraq _ along 
with Kurds in the north _ staged uprisings against what they thought 
was a brutal ruler vulnerable to overthrow. Saddam rallied his troops 
and crushed both rebellions, then waged a decade-long campaign to 
slaughter the Shiite usurpers. Since many were from the marshlands, 
human rights groups say he accelerated the draining and seeming destruction 
of the bogs. Ramadan Albadran grew up in the swamps around al Amara 
in a house built from clay and reeds, a veritable vineyard growing 
on the roof. As a young man, he participated in the rebellion, then 
fled to Saudi Arabia for his life. ``Most of my friends were killed,'' 
said Albadran, 39, who was granted refugee status and now lives in 
Los Angeles. Yet he'd go back to the swamps if he could. There was 
nothing quite like sitting on the porch in the cool morning breeze, 
admiring the view of the Tigris river, eating a peach or pomegranate 
plucked from the surrounding forest of fruit. ``You had to use a boat 
to pick the fruit,'' he said. ``But you could catch any kind of fish 
without leaving the house.'' Though Saddam gets most of the blame 
for destroying the marshes, neighboring Turkey and Syria have played 
a role by damming rivers upstream to irrigate farms. Iran is building 
a huge dam that the U.N. Environment Program believes will further 
drain the marsh. Preserving the remaining 7 percent _ down from 10 
percent just two years ago _ is crucial because it provides a template 
for restoring much of the rest of the marshes, said Hassan Partow, 
a UN environmentalist in Geneva. The wetlands are the last redoubt 
for such rare species as the African darter fish and the Sacred Ibis 
bird, and a pit stop for many migratory birds. Creatures unique to 
the marshland might even be gone, such as the smooth-covered otter, 
the bandicoot rat and the buni fish, he said. The marsh also served 
a crucial role in protecting the Persian Gulf and its vibrant fishery, 
said Tom Crisman, a University of Florida environmental engineer and 
director of the school's Center for Wetlands. Before Saddam used a 
system of dikes and canals to divert the river waters, the intricate 
maze of pools, streams and marshes was a dazzling delta that sprawled 
to the horizon. Refugees now describe much of it as an ocean of fetid 
mud with polluted groundwater, sprinkled with garbage and land mines. 
Other sections are dry and dusty, dotted with the flattened, crinkled 
remains of the magnificent stands of reeds that once stood up to 15 
feet tall. The war is likely to leave a legacy of unexploded ordinance 
and other, less-lethal, refuse of combat. Some of the heaviest fighting 
has taken place in the marsh areas, particularly around the cities 
of Nasariyha, Basra and Umm Qasr. In addition to being a remarkable 
wildlife habitat, the marshes served a crucial role in the health 
and nutrition of the whole Persian Gulf region, Crisman said. The 
marshes were an important source of protein, in the form of fish and 
water buffalo, and served as a filter for the Tigris and Euphrates 
Rivers that flank and feed it. Wetlands act as natural wastewater 
treatment systems for waterway contaminants. Now the two rivers are 
carrying waste from Iraq directly into the Persian Gulf, Crisman said, 
posing a threat to a fishery on which the entire Gulf region depends. 
Though Iraq is second only to Saudi Arabia in proven oil reserves, 
90 percent of the country is unexplored because of 23 years of wars 
and global sanctions, according to the U.S. Energy Intelligence Agency. 
``I'm not sure how many untapped reserves lie in the marshes, but 
it's certainly a prolific oil-bearing region,'' said Lowell Feld of 
the Energy Intelligence Agency. ``So, it is fair to say that there's 
probably a lot more oil to be found in the area.'' With the prospect 
of the prison-like country opening its doors, oil companies around 
the world are hungrily eyeing a postwar Iraq, said Ruba Husari, London-based 
researcher for the industry research firm Energy Intelligence Group. 
``Everybody is interested,'' she said. The Russian company Lukoil 
signed a contract for the West Qurna field in 1997, but Iraq voided 
it last December after the Russian government lobbied the Bush administration 
to let the contract stand should the Americans conquer Iraq and form 
a new government. Even in January, as war appeared imminent, Russia 
was in Iraq, negotiating for the rights to either the Majnoon or Nah 
bin Umar fields, she said. Those fields overlap the marshlands. Hassan 
said the oil production could provide the revenue needed to restore 
the Mesopotamia Marshlands to some semblance of its past splendor. 
Although the oil companies have wealth and power on their side, the 
marshlands restoration project is backed by an Iraqi opposition group 
lightly funded by the U.S. government. Crisman, a scientist on the 
project's advisory committee, said at some point ``the oil companies 
will have to be engaged.'' Project Director Suzie Alwash said the 
restoration project _ called ``Eden Again'' _ has just hired its first 
full-time staffer and hasn't had the time or resources to coordinate 
yet with the petroleum firms. ``It kind of depends on which oil companies 
get the deals,'' she said. ``If it's a Russian oil company, I don't 
think we're going to get much help. But if it's an American oil company, 
we may be able to do something.'' But Alwash, a geologist, said there 
is no hard evidence that there is oil under all the marshlands, but 
that the vast region could accommodate both petroleum and paradise. 
There are half a million Marsh Arabs, most of them displaced and many 
living in refugee camps, and Eden Again's goal is to make the swamps 
suitable to restore their culture _ an environmental and anthropological 
task of perhaps unprecedented proportions. ``An ecosystem has a memory. 
The sediments are there from thousands of years,'' Crisman said. ``But 
what about the cultural memory? It's much shorter. Can the people, 
can their culture rebound? It's a whole new ballgame.'' The future 
of the marshlands are an example of a larger issue facing the custodians 
of postwar Iraq, said J. Brian Atwood, dean of the Humphrey Institute 
of Public Affairs and former director of the U.S. Agency for International 
Development. ``The one thing that is crucial about the reconstruction 
is that the Iraqis play a large part in the process and we pay attention 
to them and understand the importance of the culture, such as these 
marshlands,'' Atwood said. ``The Iraqi people are not used to being 
listened to,'' he said, ``and it would be mistake to continue that 
attitude.''

Hong Kong health officials said Tuesday they may set up quarantine 
centers in rural areas to house hundreds of people exposed to the 
deadly flu-like illness that has killed 62 people worldwide. Meanwhile, 
officials revised downward the number of people believed affected 
with severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, from an apartment 
complex where 240 people were quarantined Monday. Authorities earlier 
said 213 people from the Amoy Gardens apartments had symptoms of the 
disease. But Health Department spokeswoman Eva Wong put the number 
at 185 on Tuesday. Four recreational activity camps in outlying Hong 
Kong areas could be turned into quarantine centers if the Health Department 
decides it's necessary, said Gordon Tam, a spokesman for the Leisure 
and Cultural Services Department. The camps could accommodate about 
1,000 people. Health Director Dr. Margaret Chan told Amoy Gardens 
representatives on Tuesday that quarantined residents would be moved 
to those camps if officials determine the source of the disease remains 
in the apartment block, according to lawmaker Fred Li, who took part 
in the discussion. Hong Kong has recorded 610 cases of SARS and 15 
deaths, out of global total of more than 1,600 infections and about 
60 deaths.

Rescue officials struggled early Tuesday to reach victims buried by 
a landslide that roared through a remote gold-mining town in Bolivia's 
tropical lowlands and killed at least four people. ``It's still too 
early to estimate the level of damage,'' said La Paz Gov. Mateo Laura, 
who is leading a rescue mission that has been delayed by heavy rains 
and bad roads to the jungle town of Chima, 125 miles (200 kilometers) 
north of the capital La Paz. ``We simply have had no contact with 
the town,'' he said. ``To talk about death numbers would be inappropriate.'' 
The landslide early Monday buried dozens of homes and left at least 
three people injured in the town of about 3,000 impoverished gold-miners 
and their families, who have been burrowing into the mountain for 
the past 70 years in search of a meager living. Government officials 
say the disaster may have been caused by gold-mining operations that 
weakened a nearby mountain. Villagers spent the afternoon digging 
through a mountain of mud, rock and muck to reach survivors. Rescue 
officials were expected to begin arriving at the remote village, about 
12 hours by road from the capital, early Tuesday morning. The government's 
only form of communication with the village so far had been a small 
radio at the gold mine. The U.S. Embassy in La Paz offered rescue 
crews and the use of four helicopters and a C-130 cargo plane. But 
they were not expected to arrive before Wednesday afternoon because 
there is no refueling point in the Bolivian jungle. It was still unclear 
how many people were affected by the landslide. Local officials backed 
off on initial reports that said 400 homes had been destroyed and 
many people were missing. ``I want to insist, the disaster is not 
of the enormous magnitude as we at first thought,'' said Amadeo Herrera, 
a Chima resident who spoke on La Paz radio station Fides. Herrera 
said he spoke to mining officials by radio, who reported 10 dead and 
eight injured. State officials could only confirm four dead and three 
injured. Officials said many people were working in the mines when 
the mountain collapsed, but gave no other details. ``It's clear there 
are people injured, missing and some dead,'' said Oscar Mina, head 
of La Paz's public security unit. ``But the big problem is all the 
confusion this has caused. We've received all types of information.'' 
One of the few buildings spared by the landslide was the village schoolhouse, 
said Toridio Mercado, deputy mayor of Tipuani, a neighboring village 
with a clinic receiving the injured. ``The situation is urgent,'' 
Mercado said. ``We don't have even the basic resources. We have two 
doctors and they need gauze, syringes, plaster and body bags.'' The 
village suffered a similar landslide two years ago that left eight 
dead. Authorities say that mining tunnels have continually undermined 
the mountain and put it at risk of collapse.

Allied aircraft bombed a complex that serves as the office of the 
Iraqi National Olympic Committee and, according to Iraqi dissidents, 
a torture center run by Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Odai, the U.S. 
military said Tuesday. ``Coalition aircraft used precision-guided 
munitions to target a regime office complex in eastern Baghdad,'' 
a U.S. Central Command statement said. The attack on the office of 
the Olympic Committee, which Odai heads, happened Monday night. ``The 
strike was executed to erode the command and control capabilities 
of regime leaders,'' the statement said. Centcom said the complex 
also housed Iraq's Ministry of Youth. The extent of damage was being 
assessed. Critics of the Saddam have campaigned to have Iraq thrown 
out of the International Olympic Movement because of widespread allegations 
that Odai Saddam Hussein had tortured his own country's athletes and 
used the Olympic center as a site for torturing both athletes and 
others. Iraq had repeatedly denied such allegations. In January, an 
official of the International Olympic Committee said it was investigating 
these allegations. Last year, the London-based human rights group 
Indict demanded that the IOC expel the Iraqi Olympic Committee from 
its ranks. Citing witness statements by exiled Iraqi athletes and 
United Nations reports, Indict claimed Odai, once made a group of 
track athletes crawl on newly poured asphalt while they were beaten, 
and ordered that some be thrown off a bridge. The group also alleged 
Odai ran a special prison for sportsmen who offended him.

India will spend 400 billion rupees (US$8.3 billion) over the next 
five years on power sector reforms in an attempt to overcome serious 
energy shortages. Losses due to poor infrastructure and power theft 
amount to 260 billion rupees (US$5.4 billion) a year in India, Parliamentary 
Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said after the federal Cabinet approved 
the proposal Monday. Several foreign investors have fled India after 
a decade of failed power reforms and policy wrangles, and domestic 
investors are wary of the power sector. Poorly maintained equipment 
and use of electricity lines by nonpaying customers often lead to 
power blackouts. Nearly 200 billion rupees (US$4.15 billion) will 
be spent over the next five years on strengthening the power infrastructure 
in India's 29 states, Dow Jones Newswires reported. An equal amount 
will be used to cut the accumulated losses of state electricity boards, 
which generate and distribute power, Swaraj told reporters. ``We have 
to give incentives to states to cut their losses,'' she said. Reducing 
distribution losses was likely to save 6,000-7,000 megawatts of electricity 
a year, a government statement said. India needs to generate an additional 
11,000 megawatts a year to meet its power requirements. Nuclear power 
supplies about 3 percent of India's electricity. The government plans 
to increase that to 10 percent by 2005 in an effort to tackle the 
country's serious energy shortages.

Human rights activists and judicial officials in Guatemala face ``deliberate 
and systematic'' intimidation while women, children and minorities 
are ignored and abused, a U.S. report said Monday. The State Department's 
annual report on human rights in this Central American country echoed 
the warnings of a similar report released Saturday by the Inter-American 
Human Rights Commission. ``The biggest concern was the increase in 
attacks against human rights activists in 2002,'' said a U.S. Embassy 
news release summarizing the report. ``The number and pattern of these 
attacks point to a deliberate and systematic effort to intimidate'' 
the activists, the statement said, adding that some of the offensive 
action could be traced to clandestine groups connected to the government. 
The report also blamed government security forces for arbitrary arrests 
and torture and criticized the government's offer to pay the ex-paramilitaries 
it recruited during the country's 36-year civil war, calling it ``an 
insult to the victims.'' More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, 
died during the war, which ended in 1996. The government agreed this 
month to pay ex-paramilitary members US$660 each in three installments 
_ one this year, and two next year. But the ex-paramilitaries want 
US$2,500 handed over in one payment. Hundreds of the former paramilitary 
members blocked highways and attacked an oil pipeline Monday to push 
their demands. The State Department report also said that women, children, 
Indians and those with disabilities continued to suffer abuse and 
neglect, while only ``limited steps'' had been taken to help them 
as promised in the peace accords signed at the end of the war. The 
Inter-American Human Rights Commission report released Saturday concluded 
that human rights and democracy are threatened in Guatemala due to 
widespread corruption, ongoing threats against human rights activists, 
and neglect of the country's most vulnerable citizens, especially 
children.

Cuban authorities were negotiating early Tuesday at Havana's airport 
with a man who claimed to be carrying two grenades on a plane with 
46 other people aboard that he unsuccessfully tried to hijack to the 
United States. Authorities said the plane was forced to land in Havana 
due to insufficient fuel after it was hijacked on a regular flight 
to the Cuban capital from the small Isle of Youth late Monday. A government 
statement released early Tuesday said the Soviet-made AN-24 was on 
a regular passenger flight from the Isle of Youth's main city of Nueva 
Gerona when the pilot reported that the craft was being hijacked to 
the United States by a man armed with grenades. ``The Cuban authorities, 
for their part, will undertake the maximum effort to find a solution 
that preserves the safety and lives of passengers and crew members,'' 
said the statement, distributed to international reporters here. The 
statement blamed the hijacking attempt on what Havana said is the 
lax treatment of six other suspected hijackers who successfully forced 
another passenger plane from Cuba to Key West, Florida, at knifepoint 
on March 19. The suspected hijackers were charged by U.S. authorities 
with conspiracy to seize an aircraft by force and violence, but were 
granted bond pending trial on the federal charges. However, they couldn't 
make the bond payments and remain in detention. ``The entire responsibility 
of what could happen (in the latest hijack attempt) will fall on the 
government of that country,'' the Cuban statement said of the United 
States. Six crew members and 25 passengers were on the twin-engine 
Douglas DC-3 on March 19 when knife-wielding hijackers took control 
of the plane as it descended toward Havana after a flight from the 
Isle of Youth. They diverted the plane to Key West. Cuban authorities 
later reported that the plane barely had enough fuel to get to American 
soil. The earlier hijack occurred as the U.S.-led war on Iraq was 
being launched. American fighter jets scrambled from Homestead Air 
Force Reserve Base and a U.S. Customs Black Hawk helicopter joined 
them to escort the blue and white plane to Key West.

Washington accused Pakistan's largest nuclear facility of sharing 
technological know-how to make weapons of mass destruction or missiles 
capable of delivering them, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said. Islamabad 
said the allegation was ``baseless.'' Linda Cheatham said Monday another 
``country, person or entity'' was involved in the technology transfer 
and refused to say which. But a North Korean firm, Changg Wang Sinyong 
Corp., was also slapped with sanctions, apparently for its alleged 
role in missile transfers with Pakistan. On Tuesday, Pakistan demanded 
Washington provide proof. ``This is absolutely baseless. We ask America 
to come up with whatever evidence they have to prove what they are 
saying,'' Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told The Associated 
Press Tuesday by telephone. ``We have neither imported and/or exported 
nuclear technology to anyone,'' Ahmed said. The Bush administration 
imposed two-year sanctions on Khan Research Laboratories, or KRL, 
Cheatham said. The sanctions took effect Monday and ban all U.S. sales 
and contracts with the laboratory. In recent months Pakistan has fended 
off renewed charges that it sold its nuclear technology to North Korea 
in exchange for the Nodong missile. Pakistan's Ghauri missile series 
_ tested last October and capable of carrying a nuclear payload deep 
into India _ is a copy of North Korea's Nodong missile, the Federation 
of American Scientists has said. Cheatham said the lab allegedly made 
``material contributions'' to another country, person on entity's 
efforts to ``use, acquire, design, develop and/or secure weapons of 
mass destruction, and/or missiles capable of delivering weapons.'' 
The Federation of American Scientists describes the KRL as Pakistan's 
main nuclear weapons laboratory where uranium is enriched. Earlier 
this year, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell sought assurances 
from Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf that the there was no help 
between Pakistan and North Korea.

Key developments in the war: _ U.S.-led troops fought pitched battles 
with the Republican Guard in Hindiyah, within 50 miles (80 kilometers) 
of Baghdad, and at least 35 Iraqis were killed and several dozen others 
captured. Coalition warplanes pounded Baghdad and dozens of other 
Iraqi positions in advance of the battle for the capital. _ U.S. troops 
shot and killed at least seven Iraqi civilians _ some of them children 
_ in a van at a checkpoint in southern Iraq when the driver did not 
stop as ordered, U.S. Central Command said. It said initial reports 
indicated the soldiers followed the rules of engagement to protect 
themselves. _ Six explosions in rapid succession shook central Baghdad, 
sending smoke billowing from the Old Palace presidential compound 
and bathing the sky in a soft orange glow. The blasts were some of 
the strongest since the war began, and a steady rumbling of explosions 
continued south of the capital early Tuesday _ likely against Republican 
Guard positions. _ Iraq's foreign minister, Naji Sabri, said Iraqi 
forces would defeat American and British forces, and only surrender 
would save coalition troops from the ``holocaust.'' More than 5,000 
Arabs have come to Iraq to help attack the invaders, he said. _ Iraqi 
television aired footage of Saddam Hussein with sons Odai and Qusai 
at a meeting of top military commanders. There was no way of determining 
when the video was shot. _ The Pentagon said U.S. and British air 
strikes have caused ``a very significant weakening'' of Iraqi forces, 
and Iraqi commanders are moving Republican Guard troops around to 
shore up their strength. _ The 82nd Airborne Division killed about 
100 ``regime terror squad members'' and captured about 50 prisoners 
at the Shiite holy city of Najaf and another town, according to U.S. 
Central Command. _ Coalition commanders said a U.S.-led assault on 
a compound controlled by an extremist Islamic group turned up a list 
of names of suspected militants living in the United States and what 
may be the strongest evidence yet linking the group to al-Qaida. _ 
In northern Iraq, U.S. aircraft pounded Iraqi positions near Kalak, 
aiding Kurdish fighters as they seized territory from Saddam Hussein's 
fleeing troops. _ British commandos destroyed Iraqi tanks and seized 
equipment in a suburb of Basra. A Royal Marine was killed and the 
Iraqis suffered a ``large number of casualties,'' the British said. 
_ Arab and Islamic nations issued a statement saying they would push 
for adoption of a resolution in the U.N. General Assembly against 
the U.S.-led war in Iraq. The statement came from the Organization 
of the Islamic Conference Group, which has 57 member nations. _ President 
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt warned that a drawn-out war in Iraq will lead 
to an increase in Islamic militancy throughout the world. _ U.S. television 
network NBC fired journalist Peter Arnett after he gave an interview 
to state-run Iraqi TV saying the U.S.-led coalition's first war plan 
had failed because of Iraq's resistance. _ The first U.N. humanitarian 
aid, a few truckloads of food and water, trickled across Iraq's borders 
from Turkey and Kuwait, U.N. agencies reported Monday. _ The Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, a U.S. civil rights activist, told families of two 
missing journalists of New York daily Newsday, who were last seen 
in Baghdad. that he would try to help figure out their whereabouts. 
_ Australia said it will replace two of its frigates in the Persian 
Gulf with one, scaling down its naval involvement in the Iraqi conflict.

All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu is expected to be sidelined for at least 
a month due to a chronic kidney problem. ``Jonah's health is paramount 
and his doctors have recommended that he take a full break from rugby 
so that he can receive the appropriate medical treatment,'' said New 
Zealand Rugby Football Union spokesman Steve Tew. With selection for 
the New Zealand World Cup squad on the line, his absence has come 
at a bad time for Lomu, who was voted the player of the 1995 World 
Cup in South Africa. Doubts about his fitness emerged with a series 
of disappointing performances that led to him being dropped from the 
Hurricanes' lineup for a Super 12 clash against the Sharks last month. 
Lomu was diagnosed as having nephritic syndrome, a rare kidney disorder, 
at the end of 1996 and he has been receiving regular treatment, including 
consultations with All Blacks doctor John Mayhew. ``This is a chronic 
intermittent condition which has fluctuated over the last six or seven 
years,'' Mayhew was quoted saying by the New Zealand Press Association. 
``We are hopeful that the modifications in his treatment will enable 
him to return to rugby in the near future. We will re-evaluate the 
situation after four weeks.'' Mayhew said Lomu was ``playing with 
a serious medical handicap all the time,'' but was a remarkable individual 
who didn't complain, despite being ``seriously handicapped since 1996.'' 
All Blacks coach John Mitchell said everyone involved with the team 
hoped to see Lomu back on the rugby field soon. (jp)

Hundreds of Guatemala's former paramilitary members blocked highways 
and attacked an oil pipeline Monday, urging the government to pay 
them more for fighting alongside the military during the country's 
36-year civil war. The government agreed this month to pay ex-paramilitary 
members US$660 each in three installments _ one this year, and two 
next year. But protesters said Monday they want US$2,500 handed over 
in one payment. They blocked highways for a few hours early Monday 
before officials cleared them from roads, police spokesman Faustino 
Sanchez said. Later Monday, Radio Sonora reported that 3,000 demonstrators 
took over an oil pumping station belonging to the French company Perenco 
and began emptying oil from one of the pipelines in Las Pozas, 180 
kilometers (110 miles) north of Guatemala City. No one from the company 
would confirm the report. A spokesman for the Department of Energy, 
Juan Carlos Ruiz, said that unidentified vandals had provoked an oil 
spill at the plant. He did not say how much oil had leaked. Former 
members of the paramilitary patrols have longed demanded some form 
of payment, arguing they were obligated to work for the government 
without pay. But such payments have been criticized by human rights 
groups who say the patrols were responsible for many of the human 
rights abuses committed in the war that killed 200,000 people, mainly 
civilians. The U.S. State Department, in its annual report on human 
rights in Guatemala released Monday, called the payments ``an insult 
to the victims.'' The patrols, alongside army troops, would often 
attack neighboring villages where rebel sympathizers were thought 
to be active. Residents of those villages were frequently massacred.

The U.S. Army has suspended a Hungarian-based program that sought 
to train Iraqi dissidents for non-combat roles in the war, military 
officials said. It did not say why the program was suspended or how 
many dissidents had participated. But local media reported that about 
80 volunteers had completed training at the Taszar base in southern 
Hungary, dubbed ``Camp Freedom.'' The Iraqis were trained in two groups 
_ the first group finishing in February, the second on Friday. Maj. 
Gen. David Barno, the Training Task Force commander, said in a statement 
that the Iraqi volunteers already deployed were making ``invaluable 
contributions'' to coalition efforts. Barno said the first group of 
volunteers was in the Gulf region helping coalition civil affairs 
units deliver humanitarian aid through the southern Iraqi port of 
Umm Qasr. The second group also would be sent to the region, he said. 
The Army recruited the volunteers from Iraqi opposition groups around 
the world, although most had been living in the United States. They 
represent the major Iraqi ethnic and religious groups, including Shiites, 
Sunnis and Kurds. The Hungarian government had authorized the United 
States to bring 1,500 trainers and up to 3,000 Iraqis for non-combat 
training sessions to Taszar, located 200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest 
of Budapest. A spokesman for the Hungarian government, J. Zoltan Gal, 
told the state-run news agency MTI that the end of the training program 
in Taszar increased Hungary's security and essentially put an end 
to Hungary's contribution to the war effort. Last week, the main opposition 
party asked the government to withdraw Hungary's name from a list 
of countries supporting the U.S.-led war in Iraq. Recent polls indicate 
that at least 70 percent of Hungarians oppose the war. The U.S. military 
has used Taszar since December 1995, when it transformed the Hungarian 
military base into a logistics post for NATO-led peacekeepers in Bosnia.

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. forces launched missiles early Tuesday toward 
Baghdad and the city of Karbala to the southeast, where circling warplanes 
bombed targets in the area. A massive explosion at 9:30 a.m. shook 
buildings inside the city. It wasn't immediately known what was hit. 
A steady series of explosions rumbled south of the capital Monday 
night and into Tuesday morning _ likely against Republican Guard positions 
_ after some of the strongest blasts in Baghdad since the U.S.-led 
air war began March 20. Six explosions in rapid succession shook central 
Baghdad Monday night, sending smoke billowing from the Old Palace 
presidential compound and bathing the sky in a soft orange glow. Across 
the Tigris River, on its east bank, another target was hit in the 
city center less than a mile (kilometer) from the Palestine Hotel. 
The foundation of the 18-story hotel, where foreign journalists are 
staying, shook as if it had been struck by a powerful earthquake. 
U.S. military officials said allied aircraft bombed a complex that 
serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where 
Iraqi dissidents say Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai runs a 
torture center. Also Monday night, Odai and Qusai, Saddam's other 
son, appeared on Iraqi television, with the station showing footage 
of a meeting of top military commanders. There was no way of determining 
when the video was shot. Saddam decorated commanders and troops of 
army units in Umm Qasr, the Faw peninsula and Nasiriyah for their 
``heroic'' defense of the areas, state television said. A communique 
read on Iraqi Satellite Television said members of the 11th Division, 
which fought in Nasiriyah, would receive medals and their families 
would immediately receive 2 million dinars _ about US$670 at the exchange 
rate on the eve of the war. Saddam was last shown on Iraqi television 
Saturday night. Odai had not been seen on Iraqi TV since the war began, 
according to Al-Arabiya television. U.S. attempts to silence Iraqi 
TV and radio and halt propaganda through aerial attacks have failed, 
with Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf insisting the broadcasts 
were unaffected. Despite repeated bombings of the Iraqi Information 
Ministry and Iraqi transmitters, the local media operation was ``as 
good as it was before'' the attacks, al-Sahhaf said. Iraqi television 
was off for about three hours Monday morning before broadcasts resumed. 
In Qatar, Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks of U.S. Central Command said Monday 
that damage to the transmission facilities meant the civilian population 
``did not see much of the regime at this time.'' Al-Sahhaf condemned 
the Americans and the British as ``saboteurs of the first rate who 
deserve nothing less than death.'' He also claimed that Iraqi fighters 
had killed 43 coalition soldiers Sunday. The official death count 
released by the United States and Britain was 70 since the war began. 
``They deny and spread lies'' about their casualties, Al-Sahhaf said. 
Foreign Minister Naji Sabri, meeting with reporters at the Palestine 
Hotel, warned that only surrender could save coalition troops from 
a ``holocaust.'' ``Every day that passes the United States and Britain 
are sinking deeper in the mud of defeat,'' Sabri said. ``Those two 
states have no choice but to withdraw early and fast, today before 
tomorrow.'' Nearly all of Baghdad's telephone lines appeared out in 
the city of 5 million after at least five telephone exchanges were 
struck. But the city's power supply remains intact and street lights 
came on at night. Coalition bombardments have focused recently on 
Republican Guard units protecting the approaches to Baghdad, to try 
to wear down Saddam's best-trained forces ahead of a U.S.-led ground 
assault on the capital.

An opposition Congress party worker and at least four suspected Islamic 
militants were killed in India's portion of disputed Kashmir on Tuesday, 
police said. Suspected guerrillas barged into the village home of 
Congress party member Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh, shooting and killing 
him, said a police officer on condition of anonymity. The attack took 
place in Kreeri, a village 45 kilometers (30 miles) north of Srinagar, 
the summer capital of Indian-held Kashmir. Separately, a suspected 
militant was killed in a five-hour gunbattle between paramilitary 
soldiers and suspected rebels hiding in a house in Kapran, a village 
55 kilometers (35 miles) south of Srinagar, the officer said. In nearby 
Kulgam village, three suspected militants were killed in another gunbattle 
with Indian soldiers, police said. More than a dozen groups of Islamic 
militants have been fighting for Muslim majority Kashmir's independence 
from predominantly Hindu India, or its merger with Islamic Pakistan, 
since 1989. At least 61,000 people have been killed in the conflict. 
India accuses Pakistan of training and arming the rebel groups, a 
charge Islamabad denies. The two countries have fought two wars over 
control of Kashmir. Both countries claim the entire Himalayan territory, 
which is divided between the two by a cease-fire line.

North Korea test-fired a ground-to-ship missile Tuesday, Japanese 
officials said, just days after Tokyo launched its first spy satellites 
into orbit to keep watch over the North's missile and nuclear programs. 
Japan's launch angered the communist state, which threatened to test-fire 
a missile. The launch Tuesday added to growing fears in Japan that 
the reclusive state may take advantage of the war in Iraq to escalate 
its missile and nuclear development. The short-range missile, with 
a range of about 60 kilometers (37 miles), was fired from the northwestern 
coast of the Korean Peninsula, Japanese defense agency and transport 
ministry officials said. Koichi Furusho, chief of staff of the Maritime 
Self-Defense Forces, Japan's navy, said the missile was likely a routine 
test. He played down its possible dangers and told reporters that 
his forces were not placed on any special alert. In Washington, a 
Pentagon official confirmed the launch of the missile, but said the 
United States does not view it as a threat. Defense Agency spokesman 
Manabu Shimamoto said the agency was still checking into details such 
as where the missile fell, but added it was a type that is ``impossible 
to reach Japan.'' North Korea fired a long-range missile that flew 
over Japan and plunged into the Pacific Ocean in 1998. It is believed 
to possess missiles that may reach parts of the United States. North 
Korea test-fired two short-range missiles in late February and early 
March amid tensions over its suspected nuclear weapons programs. Washington 
and South Korea have criticized the tests as attempts to force the 
United States into direct talks. With the United States focused on 
the war in Iraq, some experts say North Korea might exploit the opportunity 
to test long-range missiles or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make 
atomic bombs. The Korean nuclear crisis flared in October last year, 
when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted having a nuclear program 
in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington and its allies suspended 
fuel shipments, and the North retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, 
withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting 
a nuclear reactor.

The retention of the stealth fighters is likely to escalate tension 
on the Korean Peninsula. Washington has accused North Korea of having 
a secret nuclear weapons program in violation of a 1994 pact. ``Extending 
their training time in the Korean Theater of Operations affords an 
excellent opportunity to further enhance interoperability while also 
enhancing deterrence,'' the U.S. statement said. It said that in addition 
to an unspecified number of stealth aircraft, some F-15E fighter jets 
and a small Army task force would stay. About 37,000 U.S. troops are 
in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. Thousands more 
soldiers, navy and air force personnel have been here for the past 
month for war games with the South's military. The U.S. forces have 
also included the USS Carl Vinson. Those exercises _ dubbed Eagle, 
Foal Eagle and RSOI _ are scheduled to finish on Wednesday. The statement 
said more than 85 percent of the forces deployed to South Korea for 
the exercises would leave April 4. The announcement came as North 
Korea test-fired a ground-to-ship missile, Japanese defense officials 
said. The missile test came just days after Japan launched two satellites 
into orbit that will help keep watch over North Korea's missile and 
suspected nuclear arms programs. The launch angered the communist 
state.

The Tamil Tiger rebels have denied attacking a Sri Lankan vessel carrying 
government troops, one of the European monitors overseeing the cease-fire 
between the government and rebels said Tuesday. ``The LTT (Tamil Tigers) 
say they had nothing to do with the incident,'' said Hagrup Haukland, 
deputy head of the Norwegian-led monitoring team. He said a monitor 
sent to the scene of Monday's skirmish has yet to submit his report 
on the incident. Four soldiers were injured when a suspected Tamil 
Tiger rebel boat fired at the 100-meter (330-foot) Lanka Muditha, 
which was carrying more than 1,200 soldiers from the eastern city 
of Trincomalee to Jaffna, a former rebel stronghold in the north. 
The vessel returned fire, capsizing and sinking the suspected rebel 
boat, said navy spokesman Jayantha Perera. ``There might have been 
between four to six Tigers on the boat,'' Perera said. Haukland said 
the rebels' sea force commander, Soosai, had denied any involvement 
in the incident or knowledge of it. Soosai, like many rebels, uses 
only one name. The Tigers _ who were fighting for a separate homeland 
for Sri Lanka's minority Tamils _ and the government declared a truce 
in February 2002 as part of efforts to end a 19-year civil war. But 
truce monitors have warned that a recent rise in deadly clashes at 
sea could hamper continuing peace talks. A March 10 sea battle between 
the navy and the rebels left 11 guerillas dead. Fifteen Chinese and 
two Sri Lankans were killed on March 21 when their fishing vessel 
was attacked. Nine of the boat's crew survived and later said rebels 
were behind the attack. The rebels denied involvement.

Cuban authorities were negotiating earlyTuesday at Havana's airport 
with a man who claimed to be armed with two grenades on a plane with 
46 other people aboard after he unsuccessfully tried to hijack it 
to the United States. Authorities said the plane was forced to land 
in Havana because of insufficient fuel after it was hijacked on a 
regular flight to the Cuban capital from the small Isle of Youth late 
Monday. At 1 a.m. EDT (0600 GMT), the twin-engine plane remain parked 
on the tarmac on a remote runway as negotiations continued. It would 
be extremely difficult for an average citizen to get access to grenades 
in communist-run Cuba, where such weapons are heavily guarded by the 
military. A government statement released early Tuesday said the Soviet-made 
AN-24 was on a regular passenger flight from the Isle of Youth's main 
city of Nueva Gerona when the pilot reported that the craft was being 
hijacked to the United States by a man armed with grenades. On March 
19, another plane flying the same route was successfully hijacked 
to the United States. ``The Cuban authorities, for their part, will 
undertake the maximum effort to find a solution that preserves the 
safety and lives of passengers and crew members,'' said the statement, 
distributed to international reporters here. In the statement, Cuban 
authorities blamed the hijacking attempt on what they called the lax 
treatment that six other suspected hijackers received after successfully 
forcing a passenger plane from Cuba to Key West, Florida, on March 
19. In the earlier hijacking, knife-wielding hijackers took control 
of a twin-engine Douglas DC-3 with six crew members and 25 passengers 
as it descended toward Havana after a trip from the Isle of Youth. 
Cuban authorities later reported that the plane barely had enough 
fuel to reach American soil. The suspected hijackers were charged 
by U.S. authorities with conspiracy to seize an aircraft by force 
and violence and face a minimum of up to 20 years in federal prison. 
They were later granted bond but have not been able to post it, so 
they are still jailed. ``The entire responsibility of what could happen 
(in the latest hijack attempt) will fall on the government of that 
country,'' the Cuban statement said of the United States. The earlier 
hijack occurred as the U.S.-led war on Iraq was being launched and 
American fighter jets scrambled from Homestead Air Force Reserve Base 
and a U.S. Customs Black Hawk helicopter joined them to escort the 
blue and white plane to Key West.

Two rusty, jagged-edged beams salvaged from the ruins of the World 
Trade Center were joined together in the new bell tower of a Roman 
Catholic church. ``To have the two steel beams here ... is a sign 
of new life coming from the tragedy of the World Trade Center,'' said 
Archbishop Michael Sheehan, who toured the bell tower near the Rio 
Grande on Monday. One 30-foot-long (nine-meter-long) beam was set 
horizontally on a corner of the church and extends into a chapel where 
people will be able touch it. The other beam, 20 feet (six meters) 
long and sheared off at a sharp angle, is set vertically in concrete. 
Both beams are rusted and discolored, possibly from the intense heat 
of the fire. Plans call for a large, glassed-in entry area to be built 
so they can always be seen, even when the church is closed. Architect 
Isaac Benton said the raising of the 50-foot (15-meter) tower Monday 
marked the final step in converting a school gymnasium into a church. 
The parish's old church was demolished in the mid-1970s because of 
structural deterioration.

Boeing Capital Corp. asked a federal bankruptcy judge to replace Hawaiian 
Airlines Inc.'s ``self-dealing'' management with a trustee to oversee 
the carrier. The motion, filed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 
Honolulu, comes 10 days after Hawaiian, the larger of the state's 
two major airlines, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Chapter 
11 frees a company from the threat of creditors' lawsuits while it 
reorganizes its finances. Unless the court rules otherwise, the debtor 
remains in control of the business and its assets. ``Hawaiian's management 
_ in particular, John W. Adams, Hawaiian's chairman, chief executive 
officer and majority shareholder _ has conclusively demonstrated that 
its extensive self-dealing and inherent conflicts of interests require 
appointment of a trustee,'' the motion said. Seattle-based Boeing 
Capital, the financial arm of Boeing Co., is Hawaiian's main lessor. 
The others are International Lease Finance Corp. and Ansett Worldwide 
Aviation Inc. At the end of 2002, Hawaiian was Boeing Capital's fifth-largest 
client, with $476 million in lease agreements. Boeing claims that 
company insiders and Adams _ who holds 50.9 percent of the parent 
company's stock and has the right to nominate six of its 11 board 
members _ reaped nearly 70 percent of a $25 million stock repurchase 
plan the company began in April 2002. And despite Hawaiian's struggling 
financial condition, Adams' salary rose from $200,000 in 2000 to $600,000 
in 2002, the motion said. ``(The motion) is not a common thing for 
us, in fact this is unprecedented for Boeing Capital, but it was absolutely 
necessary based on past actions of Hawaiian's management,'' Boeing 
Capital spokesman Russ Young said. ``We feel that if a trustee is 
appointed, the interests of the creditors will be properly protected.'' 
Hawaiian disputed Boeing's claims and said it was disappointed by 
the request. ``While we have not yet had an opportunity review the 
motion, we believe it is a thinly veiled attempt by Boeing to distract 
the company and the court during the 60-day statutory period which 
the company is afforded the opportunity to renegotiate its leases,'' 
the company said in a statement. After receiving more than $30 million 
in federal grants to stabilize the airline industry following the 
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Hawaiian's board of directors used 
the proceeds as a ``reward'' to shareholders, principally Adams and 
other company insiders, the motion said. The motion also questioned 
the motive behind the March 21 bankruptcy filing, which Hawaiian at 
the time said was a result of failing ``to reach agreement with certain 
of our aircraft lessors on reducing our lease rates to market levels.'' 
Boeing Capital said Hawaiian was seeking $20 million per year from 
its lessors in contract modifications and concessions. Hawaiian was 
founded in 1929 and is the nation's 12th-largest airline, carrying 
more than 6 million passengers a year. It has 27 Boeing aircraft including 
14 767-300 and 13 717-200. Boeing Capital has a stake in 16 of the 
planes. _ _ _ On the Net: Boeing Capital Corp: http://www.boeing.com/bcc/flash.html

The president of the tiny Pacific island of Nauru had a heart attack 
and was hospitalized just weeks after his predecessor died in a U.S. 
hospital, an Australian government spokeswoman said Tuesday. Derog 
Gioura, 71, was in an Australian hospital and was expected to survive, 
the Australian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokeswoman said on condition 
of anonymity. Gioura was appointed Nauru's acting president after 
incumbent leader Bernard Dowiyogo, a diabetic for 30 years, died in 
Washington last month after an 11-hour heart operation. The spokeswoman 
said said Gioura was still acting president because Parliament had 
already dissolved and elections would take place in May, leaving the 
current political climate unchanged. Nauru, halfway between Australia 
and Hawaii, has a population of about 12,300 people living on an island 
of 20.5 square kilometers (8 square miles). It is almost totally dependent 
on Australian aid and commerce for its economic survival. Gioura's 
appointment was the latest chapter in a series of political upheavals 
that has plagued Nauru for more than 20 years. Dowiyogo had been Nauru's 
president six times since he was first elected in 1976.

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. forces launched missiles early Tuesday toward 
Baghdad and the city of Karbala to the southeast, where circling warplanes 
bombed targets in the area. A massive explosion at 9 a.m. shook buildings 
inside the city. It wasn't immediately known what was hit. A steady 
series of explosions rumbled south of the capital Monday night and 
into Tuesday morning _ likely against Republican Guard positions _ 
after some of the strongest blasts in Baghdad since the U.S.-led air 
war began March 20. Six explosions in rapid succession shook central 
Baghdad Monday night, sending smoke billowing from the Old Palace 
presidential compound and bathing the sky in a soft orange glow. Across 
the Tigris River, on its east bank, another target was hit in the 
city center less than a mile (kilometer) from the Palestine Hotel. 
The foundation of the 18-story hotel, where foreign journalists are 
staying, shook as if it had been struck by a powerful earthquake. 
U.S. military officials said allied aircraft bombed a complex that 
serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where 
Iraqi dissidents say Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai runs a 
torture center. Also Monday night, Odai and Qusai, Saddam's other 
son, appeared on Iraqi television, with the station showing footage 
of a meeting of top military commanders. There was no way of determining 
when the video was shot. Saddam decorated commanders and troops of 
army units in Umm Qasr, the Faw peninsula and Nasiriyah for their 
``heroic'' defense of the areas, state television said. A communique 
read on Iraqi Satellite Television said members of the 11th Division, 
which fought in Nasiriyah, would receive medals and their families 
would immediately receive 2 million dinars _ about US$670 at the exchange 
rate on the eve of the war. Saddam was last shown on Iraqi television 
Saturday night. Odai had not been seen on Iraqi TV since the war began, 
according to Al-Arabiya television. U.S. attempts to silence Iraqi 
TV and radio and halt propaganda through aerial attacks have failed, 
with Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf insisting the broadcasts 
were unaffected. Despite repeated bombings of the Iraqi Information 
Ministry and Iraqi transmitters, the local media operation was ``as 
good as it was before'' the attacks, al-Sahhaf said. Iraqi television 
was off for about three hours Monday morning before broadcasts resumed. 
In Qatar, Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks of U.S. Central Command said Monday 
that damage to the transmission facilities meant the civilian population 
``did not see much of the regime at this time.'' Al-Sahhaf condemned 
the Americans and the British as ``saboteurs of the first rate who 
deserve nothing less than death.'' He also claimed that Iraqi fighters 
had killed 43 coalition soldiers Sunday. The official death count 
released by the United States and Britain was 70 since the war began. 
``They deny and spread lies'' about their casualties, Al-Sahhaf said. 
Foreign Minister Naji Sabri, meeting with reporters at the Palestine 
Hotel, warned that only surrender could save coalition troops from 
a ``holocaust.'' ``Every day that passes the United States and Britain 
are sinking deeper in the mud of defeat,'' Sabri said. ``Those two 
states have no choice but to withdraw early and fast, today before 
tomorrow.'' Nearly all of Baghdad's telephone lines appeared out in 
the city of 5 million after at least five telephone exchanges were 
struck. But the city's power supply remains intact and street lights 
came on at night. Coalition bombardments have focused recently on 
Republican Guard units protecting the approaches to Baghdad, to try 
to wear down Saddam's best-trained forces ahead of a U.S.-led ground 
assault on the capital.

An Iraqi missile was shot down by a Patriot missile battery before 
it reached Kuwait, a military spokesman said Tuesday. ``Our radars 
detected a missile launched by Iraq.... It was shot down in southern 
Iraq before it entered our airspace,'' the army's Lt. Col. Awad Metawtah 
told Kuwaiti television. He said a Patriot missile hit the Iraqi missile 
at 9:05 a.m. (0605 GMT). Sirens had sounded in Kuwait City, warning 
of what appeared to be at least the 17th missile that Iraq has fired 
at Kuwait since coalition troops invaded Iraq from Kuwait on March 
20. Before dawn Tuesday, an explosion resounded across the Kuwaiti 
capital, but Metawtah said it apparently resulted from a false alarm. 
``A watch center suspected an enemy object in the northern area,'' 
he told television at the time. ``An anti-missile missile was launched 
and exploded in the area.'' But he said the report of an Iraqi missile 
launch toward Kuwait that prompted the reaction ``may not be true.'' 
On Saturday, a low-flying Iraqi missile crashed on a jetty in front 
of a major shopping center, causing minor damage to the building and 
two minor injuries. U.S. Patriot missile batteries have been guarding 
Kuwait against a series of Iraqi missile attacks.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. stealth fighter jets and other aircraft 
and troops in South Korea for joint war games will remain once the 
exercises are finished to act as a deterrent against North Korea, 
a U.S. military statement said Tuesday. Six F-117A radar-evading airplanes 
and other forces have been here for the past month for training with 
the South's military. The retention of the stealth fighters is likely 
to escalate tension on the Korean Peninsula. Washington has accused 
North Korea of having a secret nuclear weapons program in violation 
of a 1994 pact. Pyongyang has repeatedly accused Washington of plotting 
to attack it. The United States says it has no such plans. ``Extending 
their training time in the Korean Theater of Operations affords an 
excellent opportunity to further enhance interoperability while also 
enhancing deterrence,'' the U.S. statement said. A spokesman for South 
Korea's Unification Ministry said keeping the aircraft in the South 
would send a message to Pyongyang that it must not threaten its neighbors 
while U.S. forces are focussed in Iraq. The statement said that in 
addition to an unspecified number of stealth aircraft, some F-15E 
fighter jets and a small Army task force would stay. About 37,000 
U.S. troops are in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. 
Thousands more soldiers, navy and air force personnel have been here 
for the past month for war games with the South's military. The U.S. 
forces have also included the USS Carl Vinson. Those exercises _ dubbed 
Eagle, Foal Eagle and RSOI _ are scheduled to finish on Wednesday. 
The statement said more than 85 percent of the forces deployed to 
South Korea for the exercises would leave April 4. North Korea has 
accused the United States of using the war games as a pretext for 
an invasion. The announcement came as North Korea test-fired a ground-to-ship 
missile, Japanese and U.S. officials said. The missile test came just 
days after Japan launched two satellites into orbit that will help 
keep watch over North Korea's missile and suspected nuclear arms programs. 
The launch angered the communist state.

Coalition troops fighting in Iraq are currently ``seen as the villains'' 
but Iraqis will eventually welcome living in a liberated country, 
a British government minister said. Home Secretary David Blunkett 
said he was confident Britain and America would win the conflict and 
free Iraqi people from Saddam Hussein's regime. ``We know that for 
the moment we will be seen as the villains,'' Blunkett told British 
Broadcasting Corp. television Monday. ``But once this is over and 
there is a free Iraq, with a democratic state ... the population as 
a whole will say that we want a free country, we want a state to live 
in where we can use our talents to the full.'' Britain has 45,000 
personnel, including 26,000 soldiers, involved in the U.S.-led war 
on Iraq. Britain's Ministry of Defense said a soldier was killed Monday 
in southern Iraq while disposing of explosive ordnance, bringing the 
British death toll to 26 since the start of the war. The ministry 
said the soldier's family had been informed, but gave no further information. 
According to a Populus poll published in The Times newspaper Tuesday, 
78 percent of respondents think the coalition should ``strike only 
targets where there is little or no risk of Iraqi civilians being 
killed, even if this means the war lasts longer.'' Sixteen percent 
said the coalition should strike any target that helps to win the 
war, regardless of the risk to civilians. Sixty-five percent of respondents 
thought the war was going well, compared with 28 percent who believed 
it was going badly. Successive opinion polls showed a majority of 
the British public opposed a war without U.N. backing and Prime Minister 
Tony Blair took a major political gamble in committing British troops 
to military action. But public opinion has shown signs of swinging 
round now war has started and polls have shown growing support for 
force to disarm Iraq. According to the Populus survey, 60 percent 
of respondents thought Blair had done a good job handling the Iraq 
crisis, compared with 37 percent who thought he had performed badly. 
According to an ICM poll published in The Guardian newspaper Tuesday, 
52 percent of respondents support the war, compared with 34 percent 
who are opposed to the conflict. Fourteen percent were undecided. 
Populus interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults between March 
28-30. ICM interviewed 1,003 adults by telephone between March 28-30. 
The margin of error in both polls was plus or minus three percentage 
points. (ej)

In the northern port city of Hamburg, 10 owners of French restaurants 
decided last week to strike spirits, tobacco and other goods with 
U.S. brand names from their menus. Jean-Yves Mabileau from L'Auberge 
Francaise said he was happy to take part in the action, partly out 
of retaliation against the boycott of French products in the United 
States and partly to protest the war. He threatened to take things 
a step further if the war did not end soon. ``If the Americans won't 
calm down, I'll start refusing to accept American Express and other 
U.S. credit cards,'' said Mabileau, adding he didn't think the move 
would hurt business. The movement is not confined to Germany. Several 
Web sites call for Europeans to stop consuming leading U.S. products 
and other countries have seen similar calls to reject American goods. 
Greek filmmakers, including award-winning director Theo Angelopoulos, 
have called for a boycott of U.S. movies to protest the war in Iraq. 
In the southeastern French city of Bayonne, the staff of a bar run 
by anti-militarists dumped their Coca-Cola stocks into the sewers. 
The head of a leading German-American trade association warned that 
such efforts to punish the United States could backfire, hurting the 
local economy far more than U.S. multinationals. ``The Coca-Cola drunk 
in Germany is manufactured in Germany with German employees and they 
only hurt themselves,'' said Fred Irwin, head of the Frankfurt-based 
American Chamber of Commerce. The sentiment was echoed by Ricarda 
Ruecker, a spokeswoman for McDonald's Germany, who said the company 
has seen no decline in its sales. She added that the company has worked 
hard to put across the message that it was German. ``The name doesn't 
really tell you anything,'' Ruecker said. ``A boycott in Germany would 
only damage the economy here.'' Stefan Bielmeier, an economist and 
trade specialist at Deutsche Bank, said such boycotts wouldn't have 
much impact: ``I expect no visible effects here.'' Recent polls have 
shown that more than 80 percent of Germans are against the war in 
Iraq and fully stand behind Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's tough stance 
against U.S. President George W. Bush's war in Iraq. While many of 
the actions are aimed at galvanizing larger boycotts of U.S. companies, 
others, like a doctor in the northern German town of Rendsburg, are 
making more personal anti-war statements. A sign on the door to 61-year-old 
Eberhard Hoffmann's dermatology practice warns anyone from countries 
belonging to the U.S.-led alliance against seeking treatment from 
him. ``I forbid Americans and Britons, as well as anyone else who 
supports the war to enter my practice,'' he said. ``The war in Iraq 
is a crime.'' Hoffmann acknowledged he has no U.S. or British patients 
and said the action was largely symbolic.

Hong Kong health officials said Tuesday they may set up quarantine 
centers in rural areas to house hundreds of people exposed to the 
deadly flu-like illness that has killed 62 people worldwide. Meanwhile, 
officials revised downward the number of people believed affected 
with severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, from an apartment 
complex where 240 people were quarantined Monday. Authorities earlier 
said 213 people from the Amoy Gardens apartments had symptoms of the 
disease. But Health Department spokeswoman Eva Wong put the number 
at 185 on Tuesday. Separately, the Health Department said a 30-year-old 
man with SARS symptoms had flown here from Bangkok aboard Thai Airways 
Flight TG606, and they wanted to locate all other passengers. The 
man became sick while he was staying in the Thai capital from March 
25 to Saturday, but health officials in Hong Kong said they did not 
immediately know his nationality or where he contracted his illness. 
Global health officials say they have been worried by the spread of 
the illness by air travelers _ which is apparently how it moved from 
Hong Kong to Singapore, Canada and Vietnam, all of which have suffered 
deaths. Four recreational activity camps in rural Hong Kong areas 
could be turned into quarantine centers if the Health Department decides 
it is necessary, said Gordon Tam, a spokesman for the Leisure and 
Cultural Services Department. The camps could accommodate about 1,000 
people. Health Director Dr. Margaret Chan told Amoy Gardens representatives 
on Tuesday that quarantined residents would be moved to those camps 
if officials determine that the source of the disease remains in the 
apartment block, according to lawmaker Fred Li, who took part in the 
discussion. Hong Kong has recorded 610 cases of SARS and 15 deaths, 
out of a global total of more than 1,600 infections and about 60 deaths.

The first confirmed case of a deadly flu-like illness in Australia 
was a British tourist who has already recovered and flown home without 
spreading the virus to anybody else, health authorities said Tuesday. 
The man, whose identity and hometown were not released, had been in 
Singapore and was successfully treated in a Sydney hospital in late 
February, said Australia's chief medical officer Richard Smallwood. 
Smallwood said Monday it was only a matter of time before a case of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which has killed more 
than 60 people worldwide, arrived in Australia. Two people in New 
South Wales state and one person in Australia's capital, Canberra, 
are still under investigation for the illness, he said. The British 
tourist arrived in Australia on Feb. 12 after spending two days in 
Singapore. He was taken to a hospital in Sydney on Feb. 23 with a 
fever, cough, and shortness of breath. ``The person recovered after 
two weeks and was well when released from hospital,'' Smallwood said 
in a statement. ``He was very effectively cared for, all his contacts 
were traced and he did not pass his disease on to anybody else,'' 
Smallwood said at a news conference. ``He has recovered and I understand 
he has gone home so there is no risk to anyone in Australia as a result 
of his being in the country.'' Australian health authorities have 
investigated more than 30 suspected cases of SARS in the past three 
weeks. None were found to fit the World Health Organization criteria 
for SARS, except the man treated in Sydney, Smallwood said. Smallwood 
said authorities were not 100 percent sure the tourist had SARS, but 
had listed him as a confirmed case with the WHO to be safe. SARS has 
now infected more than 1,600 people in 15 countries. Smallwood also 
announced measures in Australia to help prevent travelers from spreading 
the disease. The new directives would include airline pilots having 
to declare _ before landing _ if they had any sick people on board 
who would need attention at the airport. Anyone suspected of having 
the illness would be treated immediately at the airport, Smallwood 
said.

Tokyo stocks edged higher Tuesday after losing more than 3 percent 
the day before over fears a prolonged war in Iraq could hurt Japan's 
fragile economy. The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen. The 225-issue 
Nikkei Stock Average rose 14.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to end trading 
at 7,986.72. On Monday, the index lost 307.45 points, or 3.71 percent. 
It lost 27.7 percent of its value over fiscal 2002, which ended Monday. 
The dollar bought 118.36 yen at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), down 0.66 yen from 
late Monday in Tokyo but above the 118.14 yen in late New York trading 
overnight. On the stock market, the Nikkei index was lifted by buying 
in select blue chips, including Honda Motor, Toyota Motor, TDK, Japan 
Telecom and NTT DoCoMo. The market as a whole, however, remained subdued 
as investors were discouraged by Wall Street's sharp drop overnight 
amid growing pessimism over the prospects of the Iraq war. The market 
shrugged off North Korea's test firing of a ground-to-ship missile 
Tuesday morning, traders said. A central bank survey released Tuesday 
showed business sentiment among major Japanese manufacturers worsened 
in the January-March quarter as worries grew that falling stock prices 
and the war in Iraq may hurt economic recovery. The Dow Jones industrial 
average closed out Monday's trading down 153.64 points, or 1.9 percent, 
at 7,992.13. The Nasdaq sank 28.43 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,341.17. 
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index closed up 0.96 points, or 0.12 
percent, to 788.96. The TOPIX, which includes all first-section issues, 
closed down 29.92 points, or 3.66 percent, Monday. In currencies, 
the dollar was pressured by war worries. The euro bought US$1.0887 
Tuesday afternoon in Tokyo, up from US$1.0874 late Monday. Against 
the yen, the euro traded at 128.93 yen, down from 129.40 yen. The 
yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond slipped to 0.6900 
percent from 0.7000 percent late Monday. Its price rose 0.09 to 101.02. 
Government bonds have benefited from investor anxieties. Protracted 
pessimism about the Japanese economy has prompted consumers to place 
their money in what they consider a safer investment. _ _ _ On the

North Korea test-fired a ground-to-ship missile Tuesday, Japanese 
officials said, just days after Tokyo launched its first spy satellites 
into orbit to keep watch over the North's missile and nuclear programs. 
A Japanese military official said the firing was a routine test and 
posed no immediate security threat. Japan's satellite launch angered 
the communist state, which threatened to test-fire a missile. The 
launch Tuesday added to growing fears in Japan that the reclusive 
state may take advantage of the war in Iraq to escalate its missile 
and nuclear development. The short-range missile, with a range of 
about 60 kilometers (37 miles), was fired from the northwestern coast 
of the Korean Peninsula, Japanese defense agency and transport ministry 
officials said. Koichi Furusho, chief of staff of the Maritime Self-Defense 
Forces, Japan's navy, said the missile was likely a routine test. 
He played down its possible dangers and told reporters that his forces 
were not placed on any special alert. In Washington, a Pentagon official 
confirmed the launch of the missile but said the United States does 
not view it as a threat. A spokesman for South Korea's Unification 
Ministry said on condition of anonymity the missile-firing would not 
worsen the crisis over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program, 
noting it was not fired toward Japan. But the U.S. military said Tuesday 
that U.S. stealth fighter jets and other aircraft and troops in South 
Korea for joint war games will remain after the exercises are finished 
to act as a deterrent against North Korea. Japanese Defense Agency 
spokesman Manabu Shimamoto said the agency was still checking into 
where the missile fell but added it was ``impossible to reach Japan.'' 
North Korea fired a long-range missile that flew over Japan and plunged 
into the Pacific Ocean in 1998. It is believed to possess missiles 
that may reach parts of the United States. North Korea test-fired 
two short-range missiles in late February and early March amid tensions 
over its suspected nuclear weapons programs. Washington and South 
Korea have criticized the tests as attempts to force the United States 
into direct talks. With the United States focused on the war in Iraq, 
some experts say North Korea might exploit the opportunity to test 
long-range missiles or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make atomic 
bombs. The Korean nuclear crisis flared in October last year, when 
U.S. officials said North Korea admitted having a nuclear program 
in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington and its allies suspended 
fuel shipments, and the North retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, 
withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting 
a nuclear reactor.

Ships, divers, helicopters and dolphins are all here looking for the 
same thing _ mines that are clogging the waters of southern Iraq and 
blocking aid shipments. The first boatload of supplies arrived last 
week at the strategic southern port of Umm Qasr, but a naval officer 
acknowledged Monday that navigating the surrounding waterways still 
poses dangers to regular aid convoys. ``There's still a lot of work 
to do,'' said Royal Navy Cmdr. Brian Mair, one of the officers heading 
up the U.S.-led coalition's mine-clearing efforts. ``If you don't 
want mistakes and accidents to happen, you have to be slow and methodical.'' 
Clearing a safe path to Umm Qasr is key to securing southern Iraq 
and creating a foothold for the rest of country. It is Iraq's only 
deep-water port, and coalition forces hope to make it the center for 
distributing humanitarian relief. In prewar days, Umm Qasr was the 
main entry point for supplies bought through the U.N.-administered 
oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to buy humanitarian goods 
with oil revenues. An estimated 3 million tons of grain, 1 million 
tons of dry foods, and 750,000 containers came through the port every 
year. War has now disrupted that flow and aid agencies are warning 
of a potential humanitarian crisis in Iraq, where a dozen years of 
economic sanctions have left some 60 percent of the country's 27 million 
people dependent on government rations. Before the shipments to Umm 
Qasr can resume, however, the treacherous Khor Abdallah channel, leading 
from the Persian Gulf to the port, must be completely swept of boat-sinking 
mines. British, American and Australian clearing teams have already 
been at it for more than a week. So far, they have largely cleared 
a 400-yard-wide (365-meter-wide) path along the 40-mile (65-kilometer) 
channel. The British supply ship RFA Sir Galahad docked there last 
Friday and unloaded the first military shipment of relief aid _ 100 
tons of water and 150 tons of rice, lentils, cooking oil, tomato paste, 
chick peas, sugar, powdered milk and tea. But Mair said it would be 
``some time'' before the port can be considered safe, stressing that 
it is probably impossible to ensure that all mines have been cleared. 
The coalition's aim is to clear 90 percent of the mines, he said. 
Mair wouldn't speculate on how many mines might be out there, but 
said ``quite a lot'' had been destroyed. Mair helps coordinate the 
tactics used in clearing mines from the USS Ponce, an amphibious support 
ship in the Gulf. The first line of defense are mine clearing ships 
_ six of them British, four American _ that blanket the seas with 
powerful sonar searching for unusual objects. Many mines use magnetic 
triggers, so the ships are made from nonmagnetic materials, like plastic, 
fiberglass and phosphor bronze. To cut down on the threat of mines 
set off by sounds or vibrations, the ships are designed to be extremely 
quiet. Once an object is found, divers or remote-controlled vehicles 
are sent to check it out. If it appears to be a mine or unexploded 
ordnance divers place an explosive on it and blow it up. Helicopters 
can also hunt for mines by dragging a ``sled'' through the water behind 
them. The sleds create a magnetic field and produce sounds and vibrations 
similar to those of a ship. The idea is to trigger mines planted on 
the seabed. And of course, there are the mine-hunting dolphins _ a 
total of nine in the region _ specially trained to use their natural 
sonar to root out the deadly underwater bombs. So far, the dolphins 
are getting rave reviews. ``The lord God decided to give them the 
best sonar ever devised,'' Mair said. ``We can only aspire to their 
ability.''

India will spend 400 billion rupees (US$8.3 billion) over the next 
five years on power sector reforms in an attempt to overcome serious 
energy shortages. Losses due to poor infrastructure and power theft 
amount to 260 billion rupees (US$5.4 billion) a year in India, Parliamentary 
Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said after the federal Cabinet approved 
the proposal Monday. Several foreign investors have fled India after 
a decade of failed power reforms and policy wrangles, and domestic 
investors are wary of the power sector. Poorly maintained equipment 
and use of electricity lines by nonpaying customers often lead to 
power blackouts. Nearly 200 billion rupees (US$4.15 billion) will 
be spent over the next five years on strengthening the power infrastructure 
in India's 29 states, Dow Jones Newswires reported. An equal amount 
will be used to cut the accumulated losses of state electricity boards, 
which generate and distribute power, Swaraj told reporters. ``We have 
to give incentives to states to cut their losses,'' she said. Reducing 
distribution losses was likely to save 6,000-7,000 megawatts of electricity 
per hour, a government statement said. India needs to generate an 
additional 11,000 megawatts per hour to meet its power requirements. 
Nuclear power supplies about 3 percent of India's electricity. The 
government plans to increase that to 10 percent by 2005 in an effort 
to tackle the country's serious energy shortages.

Chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Fujitsu Ltd. plan to combine 
their flash memory businesses into a new company that can better compete 
against industry leader Intel Corp. The new company, which will be 
called FASL LLC, will have assets of $2.5 billion when it starts operations 
in the third quarter, pending regulatory approval. It will be headquartered 
in Sunnyvale, California, where AMD is based, the companies said Monday. 
Fujitsu and AMD have worked together on flash memory in a 50-50 joint 
venture for the past 10 years but have had to compete against each 
other in some markets. Under the new arrangement, AMD will own 60 
percent of the company compared to Fujitsu's 40 percent. They also 
will be the sole distributors of FASL's memory chips, which will be 
marketed under a brand name to be announced later. ``We expect the 
new company to be the strong No. 2 player in the flash market,'' said 
Hector Ruiz, AMD's chief executive. ``The intent of Fujitsu and AMD 
is to achieve leadership in that market and gain over the competition.'' 
Flash, which is used in cell phones, digital cameras and countless 
other devices, has been a bright spot for the semiconductor industry 
even as sales of personal computers have weakened. Neither AMD nor 
Fujitsu would disclose any liabilities to be shifted to the new company 
or other financial details. FASL's chief executive will be Bertrand 
Cambou, AMD's Memory Group senior vice president. It will start with 
a global work force of about 7,000 people. AMD will contribute a chip-making 
plant in Austin as well as a research and development center in Sunnyvale 
and flash memory and assembly test operations in Thailand, Malaysia 
and China. Japan-based Fujitsu will contribute its flash memory business 
division and the Fujitsu Microelectronics final assembly and test 
facility in Malaysia. Intel Corp. is currently the leading flash memory 
maker, though in early March it warned that sales have been weaker 
than expected after a price increase. _ _ _ = On the Net: AMD: http://www.amd.com

South Korea's Defense Ministry said there was no evidence that North 
Korea had test-fired a missile Tuesday. Earlier, the Pentagon and 
Japanese authorities had said Pyongyang launched a short-range ground-to-ship 
missile off its northwest coast. ``South Korean and U.S. military 
intelligence officials have checked on the report and concluded that 
there was no missile launch by North Korea,'' a ministry official 
said on customary condition of anonymity. There was no immediate explanation 
for the conflicting reports. Before the Defense Ministry statement, 
a spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry said the alleged 
launch was ``routine.''

Well-wishers bid ``happy trails'' to the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum, 
which is moving to Branson, Missouri, from California. The museum, 
which closed its doors Sunday, hopes to open in Branson in May. Rogers 
_ known to Western movie fans as the ``King of the Cowboys'' _ died 
in 1998 at age 86. Evans, who wrote the couple's theme song, ``Happy 
Trails to You,'' died in 2001 at 88. ``We've been here 36 years in 
the high desert, so it's a little bit rough,'' said son Dusty Rogers. 
He added: ``We took mom to Branson about six years ago and she just 
loved it. Basically we're fulfilling what she wanted to do.'' Museum 
attendance _ which had peaked in the 1990s at around 75,000 visitors 
a year _ had fallen to fewer than 50,000, he said. ^ _ _ _ On the

Struggling to contain the worldwide spread of the deadly flu-like 
illness that has killed at least 62 people, worried Asian governments 
Tuesday ordered tougher infection screening of air travelers and imposed 
other emergency measures. Badly hit Hong Kong said it might open rural 
camps to quarantine people who have been possibly exposed. Authorities 
in China urged physicians treating cases of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, or SARS, to disinfect everything they touch and wear 12-layer 
surgical masks. Thailand's government invoked an emergency regulation 
to give health officials the authority to quarantine arriving travelers 
suspected of having the illness for up to 14 days. Scientists have 
yet to identify the disease that has sickened more than 1,600 on three 
continents and they are working hard to find a cure. Its initial symptoms 
include fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Most victims have 
been in Asia. Hong Kong doctors say some have responded well to antibodies 
from others who recovered from the disease. Also on Tuesday Australia 
announced its first case _ a man who been in Singapore where tough 
quarantine measures are now in place. He had recovered and the illness 
has not spread, health authorities said. Taiwan banned boats from 
sailing between an outlying island chain and mainland China, where 
the disease was first detected in November. Four recreational activity 
camps in rural Hong Kong areas could be turned into quarantine centers 
if the Health Department decides it's necessary, said Gordon Tam, 
a spokesman for the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. Meanwhile, 
hundreds of people remained confined inside a badly hit Hong Kong 
apartment building. Health officials on Monday sealed off the building 
in the 19-tower apartment complex, Amoy Gardens. Authorities said 
213 residents of the entire complex remained hospitalized, though 
by Tuesday, just 185 had shown SARS symptoms. More than 600 people 
have been infected In Hong Kong and 15 have died. In Canada, where 
a health emergency has been declared in Ontario province, Toronto 
authorities reported that at least two children had been hospitalized 
with the disease, and three others had symptoms. Taiwan temporarily 
banned shipping traffic between the Chinese mainland and the Matsu 
Islands, 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) off China's southern coast _ because 
the islands' clinics wouldn't be able to cope with a major outbreak, 
the government said Monday. Taiwan's known SARS cases remained at 
13 Tuesday, while authorities issued more than 800 quarantine orders 
to people who had come into contact with patients. The Olympic Council 
of Asia decided to shift the site of its April 22-23 meeting from 
Vietnam, where four people have died from SARS, to Thailand, an official 
of the Thai National Olympic Council said. The World Health Organization 
said Monday that experts hope to pinpoint the cause soon, and signs 
continue to point to the coronavirus, which causes about one-fifth 
of all colds. In a new and perplexing twist, the germ inside the Hong 
Kong apartment building seemed to be spreading vertically, a WHO official 
said Monday. ``They are finding that the infections are in people 
living in apartments on top of each other, only in one area of this 
apartment block,'' virologist Klaus Stohr said at WHO headquarters 
in Geneva. That differs from the pattern seen earlier at the Metropole 
Hotel in Hong Kong, where the disease spread when people who spent 
time on the ninth floor in late February were infected by a sick mainland 
Chinese medical professor. ``That was horizontal, and now you have 
a vertical connection,'' Stohr said. ``You can talk about water pipes 
and sewage pipes, about drafts which move up and down _ that's pure 
speculation. These are hypotheses that are being looked into.'' Before 
the quarantine was imposed, many residents of the apartment building 
had fled in fear as dozens of people became sick, raising the possibility 
that SARS could spread further. The other 18 buildings in the complex 
were not sealed off despite having multiple SARS cases, but Hong Hong's 
health secretary, Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, said no other buildings were 
hit as badly. ``If isolation is effective to control the spread of 
the disease, we can say that this decision came too late,'' said Leung 
Ping-chung, an orthopedic and traumatology professor who has been 
monitoring the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, where dozens 
of staff have been sickened. ``And who can say for sure who should 
be isolated?'' Leung said.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ AOL Time Warner Inc. has completed its restructuring 
of Time Warner Entertainment, paying Comcast Corp. $3.6 billion in 
stock and cash for full control of assets including Warner Bros. and 
Home Box Office. The deal finished Monday gives Comcast cash to help 
trim debt after its November acquisition of AT&amp;T Broadband, which 
made Comcast the largest U.S. cable television operator. It allows 
AOL Time Warner to regain control of entertainment assets including 
Time Warner Entertainment's interests in the WB Network, Comedy Central 
and Court TV. Time Warner and AT&amp;T had been partners in the venture 
before Comcast's acquisition of AT&amp;T Broadband. AOL Time Warner 
chief executive Dick Parsons had sought to free his company from the 
complicated TWE deal. ``The successful completion of the TWE restructuring 
is another milestone in our efforts to simplify the structure of our 
company and maximize our operating flexibility, while maintaining 
the strength of our balance sheet,'' Parsons said in a statement. 
Comcast received $2.1 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in AOL Time 
Warner stock to complete the deal. AOL Time Warner gained a 79 percent 
stake, while Comcast retains a 21 percent stake in a new subsidiary 
called Time Warner Cable Inc., the companies said. Completion of the 
restructuring clears the way for an initial public offering of Time 
Warner Cable this summer, which is designed to shore up the company's 
finances. Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts said when Comcast 
acquired AT&amp;T Broadband that the $3.6 billion would be a vital 
part of plans to reduce $30 billion in debt to $25 billion within 
18 months. The companies announced the deal's conclusion after markets 
closed Monday. AOL Time Warner's stock closed at $10.86 a share, down 
49 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Comcast's Class A shares 
fell 68 cents to close at $28.59 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

The former backup singer of imprisoned Mexican pop idol Gloria Trevi 
arrived in Mexico on Monday after Brazilian authorities extradited 
her on charges of rape, kidnapping and corruption of minors. Maria 
Raquenel Portillo, known as ``Mary Boquitas,'' was brought late Monday 
night to the maximum-security prison where Trevi is being held in 
Chihuahua, 760 miles (1,215 kilometers) northwest of Mexico City. 
Portillo was accompanied by her mother and six lawyers, including 
Trevi's lawyer, Cesar Fentanes, who announced that he was going to 
represent Portillo free of charge. ``We are going to prove her innocence 
to the authorities that have brought this case,'' Fentanes said, as 
a tired-looking Portillo was led into the prison. Portillo did not 
make a statement, but was to present a written declaration during 
a court appearance on Tuesday, Fentanes said. Brazilian authorities 
turned Portillo over to Mexican officials earlier Monday. During a 
layover in Mexico City, she blew kisses to onlookers but declined 
to make a statement before being whisked away for a medical checkup. 
At the request of Mexican authorities, Portillo was arrested along 
with Trevi and Trevi's manager, Sergio Andrade, in January 2000 in 
Rio de Janeiro. Prosecutors say the three recruited teenage girls 
for live-in musical training and forced them to have sex with Andrade. 
Trevi was extradited to Mexico on Dec. 21, after three years of fighting 
extradition while imprisoned in Brazil, where she gave birth to Andrade's 
son. She also faces charges of rape, kidnapping and corruption of 
minors. Portillo, 33, was not extradited in December because of health 
problems. Andrade remains in a federal police lockup in the Brazilian 
capital of Brasilia, and has pledged to use every legal recourse to 
avoid extradition. Nicknamed ``Mexico's Madonna,'' Trevi, 34, was 
known for her rebellious lyrics and audaciously sexual performances, 
which helped make her one of Mexico's biggest stars in the early 1990s.

Congress is balking at giving President George W. Bush the unfettered 
control he wants over money for the war with Iraq and the global confrontation 
with terrorism. The House and Senate Appropriations committees planned 
to write separate versions of the spending package on Tuesday. Both 
were ready to provide Bush with far less flexibility than he sought 
in the $74.7 billion proposal he sent lawmakers last week. The two 
Republican-controlled chambers were racing to complete work on the 
package by April 11, the target set by Bush. Both committees were 
expected to produce bills close to the president's price tag. The 
Senate was planning to add about $2 billion for the country's financially 
ailing airlines, and the House was considering including similar aid. 
Both panels were planning to clamp tighter congressional controls 
on the money than the president requested. Bush proposed giving the 
White House, Defense Department and other agencies wide leeway in 
deciding precisely how to spend much of the money, a prerogative that 
members of both parties in Congress usually protect jealously. Of 
the $62.6 billion that Bush included in his request for the Pentagon, 
he proposed giving Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld broad discretion 
over $59.9 billion. For example, $53.4 billion could be used by Rumsfeld 
``for military operations in Iraq and the global war on terrorism.'' 
Instead, aides said the House bill _ subject to last-minute changes 
_ would assign more than half that money to specific military accounts, 
based on information the White House has provided to the Appropriations 
Committee. The administration could control the rest of the money, 
but would have to notify lawmakers of its plans in advance and provide 
regular reports afterward. ``We're not going to tie their hands. We'll 
give them the flexibility they need to fight this war,'' said House 
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young. The Senate was also 
expected to provide much of the money for specific accounts, and give 
the administration more flexibility over the rest. The administration 
also proposed creating several smaller funds it would control, such 
as one giving the president $150 million for handling ``complex foreign 
crises.'' The House bill would not create that fund. The House and 
Senate bills were also expected to change other details. For example, 
Young said he was working with New York lawmakers on a way their city, 
considered a high-risk terrorist target, could be ensured of getting 
funds, rather than leaving the decision to the administration's discretion. 
The Senate's aid for airlines was expected to include funds for installation 
of reinforced cockpit doors and government-backed war risk insurance.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ AOL Time Warner Inc. has completed its restructuring 
of Time Warner Entertainment, paying Comcast Corp. $3.6 billion in 
stock and cash for full control of assets including Warner Bros. and 
Home Box Office. The deal finished Monday gives Comcast cash to help 
trim debt after its November acquisition of AT&amp;T Broadband, which 
made Comcast the largest U.S. cable television operator. It allows 
AOL Time Warner to regain control of entertainment assets including 
Time Warner Entertainment's interests in the WB Network, Comedy Central 
and Court TV. Time Warner and AT&amp;T had been partners in the venture 
before Comcast's acquisition of AT&amp;T Broadband. AOL Time Warner 
chief executive Dick Parsons had sought to free his company from the 
complicated TWE deal. ``The successful completion of the TWE restructuring 
is another milestone in our efforts to simplify the structure of our 
company and maximize our operating flexibility, while maintaining 
the strength of our balance sheet,'' Parsons said in a statement. 
Comcast received $2.1 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in AOL Time 
Warner stock to complete the deal. AOL Time Warner gained a 79 percent 
stake, while Comcast retains a 21 percent stake in a new subsidiary 
called Time Warner Cable Inc., the companies said. Completion of the 
restructuring clears the way for an initial public offering of Time 
Warner Cable this summer, which is designed to shore up the company's 
finances. Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts said when Comcast 
acquired AT&amp;T Broadband that the $3.6 billion would be a vital 
part of plans to reduce $30 billion in debt to $25 billion within 
18 months. The companies announced the deal's conclusion after markets 
closed Monday. AOL Time Warner's stock closed at $10.86 a share, down 
49 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Comcast's Class A shares 
fell 68 cents to close at $28.59 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Otis Elevator Co. on Tuesday marks 150 years in business, from its 
start using a platform hooked to a rope and wagon spring to a worldwide 
company that lifts passengers billions of times on the strength of 
a computer chip. The company, which began with the sale of a safety 
elevator by founder Elisha Graves Otis in 1853, has 1.3 million elevators 
in service around the world. It sells about 80,000 elevators a year 
and 8,000 escalators. ``But we're not really a manufacturing company,'' 
said Ari Bousbib, president of Otis. ``There's nothing secret in manufacturing 
cabs.'' The real business is maintenance. Sensors, monitors, circuits, 
hardware and computer software are now used to collect and analyze 
information on hundreds of elevator functions. If a problem is detected, 
mechanics are dispatched to fix it and restore service. ``What I would 
like to see is zero maintenance in elevators in the future,'' Bousbib 
said. ``We're far from that.'' Otis is observing its anniversary in 
New York with a three-day conference and other events during the year 
for customers and employees. Fewer employees will participate than 
would have before recent job cuts. Otis employs 60,000 workers worldwide, 
with about 7,000 in the United States. That's down from about 63,000 
internationally four or five years ago, with 8,000 to 10,000 in the 
United States. Otis, which once operated six manufacturing plants 
in the United States, now runs only a small facility in Bloomington, 
Indiana. The company has plants in Nogales, Mexico; Brazil; the Czech 
Republic; Russia and China. Otis, which installed its first commercial 
passenger elevator in a five-story department store in New York in 
1857, said its latest models don't even require a machine room. The 
elevator features flat polyurethane-coated steel belts instead of 
steel cables that have been the industry standard since the 1800s. 
The belts are about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wide and 0.1 inch (0.25 
centimeters) thick, but are as strong as steel cables and more durable 
and flexible, the company said. The thinness of the belts reduces 
the space required for the machine in the hoistway. The company was 
purchased by United Technologies for $400 million in 1975. Revenue 
in 2002 was $6.8 billion, up by more than 7 percent from the previous 
year. That represented the strongest gains among the parent's subsidiaries, 
which include Pratt &amp; Whitney, Sikorsky and Carrier. Bousbib foresees 
more changes for the elevator. ``An elevator is more complex than 
a car,'' he said. ``You go into an elevator, you press a button and 
it takes you where you want to go.''

In response to the war in Iraq, an advisory council to the governor 
of Russia's Primorye region denounced American movies as propaganda 
of U.S. global domination, the regional administration said Tuesday. 
The Council for Information Security discussed how to counter the 
alleged American propaganda at a session late last week, the administration 
said in a statement. The session was ordered by Governor Sergei Darkin, 
who was alarmed that most television stations in his region were showing 
more and more American movies. At a time when Russia is voicing vehement 
opposition to the U.S.-led war, American movies ``advocate the cult 
of force, show the invincibility of the American army and directly 
impose on viewers the postulates that the United States has the right 
to decide the future of the world,'' the administration said. ``Showing 
American films today is not as inoffensive as it may seem at first 
glance,'' it said. ``As a matter of fact, it is playing into the hands 
of the American ideological machine.'' The council said that more 
than 60 percent of television shows and films broadcast in the Primorye 
region, on Russia's Pacific coast, are made in the United States or 
under U.S. license. The advisory body recommended that law enforcement 
agencies audit local broadcasters to see whether they had bought the 
rights to the American movies that they show. The move should reduce 
U.S. content on local airwaves because many television companies use 
pirated copies of foreign films, the statement said. (am/ji/mb)

Allied aircraft bombed a complex that serves as the office of the 
Iraqi National Olympic Committee and, according to Iraqi dissidents, 
a torture center run by Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Odai, the U.S. 
military said Tuesday. ``Coalition aircraft used precision-guided 
munitions to target a regime office complex in eastern Baghdad,'' 
a U.S. Central Command statement said. The attack on the office of 
the Olympic Committee, which Odai heads, happened Monday night. ``The 
strike was executed to erode the command and control capabilities 
of regime leaders,'' the statement said. Centcom said the complex 
also housed Iraq's Ministry of Youth. The lower four floors of the 
nine-story building on Baghdad's Palestine Street were severely damaged. 
Walls were knocked through, and mangled wire and steel protruded from 
the debris. Critics of the Saddam have campaigned to have Iraq thrown 
out of the International Olympic Movement because of widespread allegations 
that Odai Saddam Hussein had tortured his own country's athletes and 
used the Olympic center as a site for torturing both athletes and 
others. Iraq had repeatedly denied such allegations. In January, an 
official of the International Olympic Committee said it was investigating 
these allegations. Last year, the London-based human rights group 
Indict demanded that the IOC expel the Iraqi Olympic Committee from 
its ranks. Citing witness statements by exiled Iraqi athletes and 
United Nations reports, Indict claimed Odai, once made a group of 
track athletes crawl on newly poured asphalt while they were beaten, 
and ordered that some be thrown off a bridge. The group also alleged 
Odai ran a special prison for sportsmen who offended him.

Singapore authorities, hoping to stop the spread of a deadly flu-like 
virus, will quarantine the men's and women's rugby teams for at least 
a week after they returned from the Hong Kong Sevens tournament. The 
26 players were checked upon arrival in Singapore and sent home for 
a weeklong quarantine, although they were all found clear of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, said team spokeswoman Rose Tan. 
SARS has killed four people and sickened at least 90 in this city-state 
of 4 million. The government has closed schools for a week and placed 
more than 1,500 people under mandatory home quarantine for 10 days 
in a bid to stop the spread of the disease. Hong Kong has recorded 
610 SARS cases and 15 deaths, out of a global total of more than 1,600 
infections and about 60 deaths. Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang had 
earlier described the association's decision to compete in the tournament 
as ``unwise.'' Singapore's Straits Times newspaper said the rugby 
association would compensate the players, all nonprofessionals, for 
missing work during their quarantine. Tan said the Singapore Sevens 
rugby tournament, scheduled for Apr 26-27, will go ahead as planned. 
The Singapore Sevens, like the Hong Kong tournament, is part of the 
World Sevens Series circuit.

Communist rebels evacuated a small train station, then blew it up 
early Tuesday in eastern Bihar state, said a railway official. There 
were no injuries, but extensive damage was caused to the building, 
the rail track and the communication system at Nadaul, 45 kilometers 
(30 miles) south of Patna, the state capital, said assistant railway 
divisional manager A.K. Verma. He said traffic had been halted on 
the line between Patna and Gaya, the site of major Buddhist temples. 
Verma said militants of the People's War Group evacuated staff from 
the Nadaul station before setting off the explosion. The group, along 
with another outlawed rebel outfit, the Maoist Communist Center, had 
called for a statewide dawn to dusk strike in Bihar on Tuesday to 
protest police brutality and the U.S.-led war in Iraq.

There is a war on, and danger lurks ahead, and the Marines of the 
3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry are getting desperate _ for tobacco. It's 
been two weeks since they left they relative luxury of their camp 
in Kuwait and their supplies of cigarettes and chewing tobacco are 
running out. They are rationing their precious supplies, and even 
begging smokes from local farmers. An army, Napoleon said, marches 
on its stomach. But for generations, armies have also marched on nicotine. 
And these Marines _ smoking more than usual under the stress of battle 
conditions _ are getting antsy. ``It just crushes morale,'' said Cpl. 
Jonathan Kibler, 22. With the few remaining shreds of tobacco nearly 
gone, the Marines here face the prospect of being involuntarily enrolled 
in what could be one of the most successful programs to end nicotine 
addiction in history. It's hard to overestimate the importance of 
tobacco to the Marines. Cigarettes are smoked at every possible break 
and the doors of many Humvees are streaked brown from the spurts of 
tobacco-filled spit that shoot out of the windows every few minutes. 
Tobacco helps relieve boredom, relax or stay awake for long nights, 
the troops say. ``It keeps your sanity,'' said Lance Cpl. Brandon 
Phelps. It has been that way for generations. During World War II, 
cigarettes were included in battle rations; on ships, sailors could 
buy whole cartons for 50 cents, $3 less than they cost on shore _ 
IF they could be bought at all. U.S. Rep. Lane Evans, a member of 
the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs, has said that, ``From the 
time of the Civil War until 1956, the Army was required by law to 
provide a cheap and nearly endless supply of tobacco to its personnel.'' 
That's changed. Since 2002, all Department of Defense facilities have 
been smoke-free _ though of course that doesn't apply to the battlefield. 
Despite the military's best efforts, 34 percent of the members of 
the service smoke, compared to 23 percent of all Americans. While 
living in their tent camp in Kuwait for nearly two months, the Marines 
were constantly resupplied with cigarette cartons and rolls of 10 
tins of chewing tobacco mailed by family members or with tobacco they 
bought themselves at the PX truck. But there are no stores in this 
desert, though many Marines swear they have huge stores of tobacco 
in the mail somewhere out there, there's yet to be a mail delivery 
and there's little hope for one soon. ``It's frustrating knowing that 
there's a box more of it back there that I haven't gotten yet,'' said 
Capt. Daniel Schmitt, 31, who ran out of chewing tobacco days ago. 
With smokers and tobacco chewers becoming more desperate, the value 
of tobacco has exploded. Cpl. Aeron Jackson, 22, sold 9 tins of chewing 
tobacco, for which he paid $4 each, for prices that started at $5 
and escalated to $20 as his comrades run out. Now he is almost on 
empty himself. But most Marines, no matter how low their stocks, are 
sharing what little they have. ``As soon as someone gets a can it's 
pretty much gone in a day,'' said Kibler. He offered to trade the 
entire contents of his day pack, except his sleeping bag, for one 
more tin. Phelps has been smoking since he was 9 and dipping since 
he was 7. But the four cans and six packs he brought from Kuwait ran 
out about a week ago and now he has to beg. ``Every time I see somebody 
light up a cigarette I'm right there: 'What's up, man?''' he said. 
So far, Marines have not exploded with nicotine rage. But they have 
become a little more irritable and uncomfortable. ``The real test 
will come when we're up for long hours and no one's got dip or smokes,'' 
Kibler said. ``If we're up for 30, 36 hours, you'll see people getting 
real edgy.'' Cpl. Matt Nale, 31, normally smokes half a pack a day. 
He brought three cartons of cigarettes with him from Kuwait, but they 
ran out nearly a week ago after he shared them with his mortar platoon. 
Desperate, he managed to bum two packs of local Sumer cigarettes _ 
stronger than his preferred Marlboros _ off Iraqi farmers in the countryside 
using hand signals to bridge the language gap. ``We've had three cigarettes 
a day for the last three days because of those farmers,'' he said.

Unidentified assailants fired rockets at two U.S. bases in Afghanistan 
and an American Humvee vehicle struck an anti-tank mine, but no casualties 
were reported in any of the incidents, the U.S. military said Tuesday. 
The armored Humvee struck the mine late Monday near the southern city 
of Kandahar, the U.S. military said in a statement from its headquarters 
at Bagram Air Base, north of the capital. ``No one was injured, but 
the vehicle sustained extensive damage to the front end. A military 
police patrol and an explosive ordnance disposal unit responded to 
the scene,'' the statement said. ``A second TC6 anti-tank mine with 
detonation cord was found and destroyed in place. The Humvee was towed 
back to base.'' It was unclear who laid the mines. Northeast of Kandahar, 
two rockets were fired at an American forces base. Later on Monday, 
another rocket was fired toward a U.S. base at Orgun in the eastern 
province of Paktika. None of the rockets hit any American facilities. 
Rockets, many Chinese-made and connected to crude water timers, have 
been fired frequently at coalition forces based in southern and eastern 
Afghanistan. The rockets, sometimes leaned against rocks, are difficult 
to aim and have rarely caused casualties. Thousands of U.S. and coalition 
troops are in Afghanistan hunting down Taliban holdouts and remnants 
of the al-Qaida terror network.

A wave of suicide bombings threatened by Iraq could entrap U.S.-led 
forces in a cycle of attack and response, prolong the war and hamper 
crucial efforts to win the trust of Iraqi civilians, Israelis and 
Palestinians said, drawing on their experience from scores of such 
attacks over the past 2{ years. Suicide attacks are difficult to prevent 
_ a reality underscored Sunday by a 20-year-old Palestinian from the 
West Bank who blew himself up in the Israeli town of Netanya, evading 
a dragnet of Israeli checkpoints. Israel says it has scored many successes, 
intercepting dozens of bombers and dismantling explosives labs in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Yet more than 90 bombers have managed 
to get through in the last 2{ years _ despite Israel's reoccupation 
of much of the West Bank, crippling travel bans on Palestinians, the 
arrests of thousands of suspected militants and the targeted killings 
of dozens. The crackdown has hurt Israel's standing in the world _ 
and Saddam Hussein appears to be trying to do the same to the United 
States. The Iraqi leader has tried to rally the Arab world behind 
him by copying the Palestinian model, the most sustained campaign 
of suicide attacks ever. After the first suicide attack against U.S. 
forces at a checkpoint near Najaf on Saturday, in which four soldiers 
were killed, Iraqi leaders said more such bombings would follow. Iraqi 
Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said thousands of Arab volunteers 
ready for martyrdom have been coming to Iraq _ raising the possibility 
that a prolonged stay of foreign forces could turn the country into 
a magnet for a Muslim jihad, or holy war. The context in Iraq is different 
from here, because the United States has no claim to Iraqi territory, 
whereas many Israelis lay claim to the West Bank and Gaza and Israel 
has established some 150 settlements in the areas. Also, Saddam's 
regime is secular, whereas most Palestinian suicide bombers have come 
from Islamic fundamentalist groups. Still, secular Palestinian groups 
have increasingly carried out such attacks as well, and Saddam could 
probably rally considerable Islamic support if the war drags on. In 
any case, Israeli counterterrorism experts say U.S. and British troops 
will have little choice but to copy some of the Israeli methods in 
response to the new threat _ and could suffer some of the same consequences. 
Military analyst Alex Fishman wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily that 
Israel has already shared with the United States some of the ``experience 
that has been accumulated here in terms of dealing with suicide bombers 
and targeted killings.'' Ziad Abu Amr, a Palestinian legislator, noted 
that Israel's crackdown has often been counterproductive, with curfews, 
travel bans and raids fueling Palestinian resentment of Israel and 
widening the circle of potential bombers. Israel's checkpoint system 
in the West Bank is the point of greatest friction between Israeli 
authorities and Palestinian civilians, who often complain about being 
humiliated or mistreated by soldiers. After Saturday's attack in Najaf, 
U.S. and British troops already appeared to be more thorough in frisking 
Iraqis who approached them. Saturday's bombing ``was deliberately 
designed to make American soldiers more nervous about Iraqi citizens,'' 
said Eran Lehrman, a former Israeli intelligence official. ``This 
is part of an attempt to destroy the hearts and minds campaign.'' 
The Najaf bombing should give the Americans a hint of what Saddam 
has in store for them once they set up their ``occupation government'' 
in Baghdad, commentator Hemi Shalev wrote in the Maariv daily Monday. 
The bombings could continue _ and on a much larger scale _ once headquarters 
are set up in cities, Lehrman said, noting that in Beirut in 1983, 
a bomber killed 241 U.S. Marines when he drove through their barracks 
with an explosives-laden truck. Such a rash of suicide attacks could 
force U.S. and British troops to devote much of their energy to preventing 
them, a difficult and time-consuming task that could drag out the 
war and broaden it to much of the population, the analysts said. ``The 
suicide attack is a type of smart bomb,'' said Boaz Ganor, an Israeli 
counterterrorism expert. ``It allows the person ... to decide on the 
time and place of the attack in order to choose the number of people 
he hurts.'' Lehrman said it could take weeks for the allied forces 
to start setting up a network of spies who will tip them off to planned 
attacks and finger militants. In hunting down _ and sometimes killing 
_ suspects, Israel relies heavily on informers. ``There are no shortcuts,'' 
he said. ``Intelligence is the key here and it will remain the key.''

Balinese Hindus ushering in their holiest day plan to torch a giant 
effigy of a key suspect in last year's deadly terrorist bombings _ 
along with dozens of other ``demons'' _ as part of a ceremony to banish 
evil from the island. Amrozi, who will soon go on trial for his alleged 
role in the attack that killed 202 people, is depicted carrying several 
sticks of dynamite attached to a timer and is dressed in prison uniform. 
``He was under the influence of an evil spirit,'' said Ida Bagus, 
one of several people who spent months constructing the stunningly 
realistic seven-meter-high (seven-yard-high) model from bamboo and 
papier mache. The evil spirit ``Butakala'' is depicted standing on 
the shoulders of Amrozi, who like many Indonesians goes by a single 
name. Later Tuesday, hundreds of people will parade the model, along 
with others representing traditional demons and monsters from Balinese 
mythology, around the island. The effigies will then be burnt in ceremonies 
meant to drive evil sprits from the island. Priests also make sacrifices 
and lead prayers at town squares and temples. Bali is overwhelmingly 
Hindu, unlike the rest of Muslim-dominated Indonesia. On Wednesday, 
the island celebrates Nyepi, or Day of Silence, when most Balinese 
refrain from going out, making noise or using electricity, and spend 
the day mediating or praying. Tourists visiting the island are asked 
not to leave their hotels and the airport is closed until Thursday 
morning. Even international flights passing over the island are rerouted 
for the day. The day is celebrated as a national holiday throughout 
Indonesia, which has a secular government and significant Christian 
and Buddhist minorities. The Oct. 12 bombings hit Bali's thriving 
tourist industry hard. Thousands of hotel workers have been laid off, 
and most restaurants, souvenir shops are struggling to stay afloat. 
Tourist arrivals have picked up slightly over the past months, but 
are still way down on what they were before the attack. Amrozi was 
the first of 29 suspects arrested over the bombings, which were the 
worst terror attacks since the Sept. 11 strikes on the United States. 
Most of the victims were Western tourists. Police say Amrozi bought 
the minivan used in the attack and delivered the explosives. He has 
told reporters he carried out the attack to avenge the oppression 
of Muslims around the world.

train station in Vizianagaram district in Andhra Pradesh state, after 
the staff was evacuated. The rebels are active in five southern and 
eastern Indian states and draw inspiration from Chinese revolutionary 
Mao Zedong in their demands for sweeping land reforms. More than 6,000 
people have been killed since they began fighting two decades ago. 
They usually target landowners, politicians and police.

The Australian government on Tuesday defended its tough imported food 
quarantine rules and said the European Union should spend more time 
weaning its farmers off subsidies and less attacking Australia's system. 
The European Union announced Monday it would challenge Australia's 
quarantine system for farm imports at the World Trade Organization, 
saying the measures unfairly protect domestic producers. ``We believe 
this system flagrantly breaches WTO rules, despite Australia's constant 
claims to be the only beacon of free agricultural trade,'' EU Trade 
Commissioner Pascal Lamy said. The EU requested formal consultations 
at the WTO, a move that could lead to a ruling by the global trade 
regulator on the legality of the Australian system. The EU action 
and Australia's reaction marked an escalation of a long-running dispute 
over agricultural trade. Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile vigorously 
defended the country's quarantine system, which in the past has banned 
imports of products like fruit because they might be infected with 
pests not yet found in Australia. ``Australia has a world-class quarantine 
system that is science-based and transparent,'' Vaile said in a statement. 
``The EU's system is not transparent and some of their decisions are 
clearly not science-based,'' he added, without elaborating. Vaile 
said instead of wasting time on a WTO case that would fail, the EU 
should focus on cutting subsidies to its farmers. ``Australia will 
not be distracted from continuing to press ahead with agricultural 
trade reform in the WTO,'' he said. ``The EU's efforts would be better 
directed towards weaning its farmers from subsidies and getting on 
with the process of agriculture reform.'' The EU accused Australia 
of double standards by pushing for freer world agricultural trade 
_ including the reduction of EU farm subsidies _ while protecting 
its own market through over-stringent health regulations. Earlier 
Tuesday, the Australian government blamed the EU and Japan for the 
WTO's failure to meet a key deadline on farm trade reform. Vaile said 
the missed deadline of March 31, under which members of the Geneva-based 
WTO were supposed to agree on a broad framework for liberalizing agricultural 
trade, was a serious setback for the latest round of global trade 
talks. ``The responsibility for this failure lies squarely at the 
feet of those members, such as the European Union and Japan, who are 
continuing to oppose efforts to bring about genuine reform of agricultural 
trade,'' Vaile said. Australia is a prominent member of the Cairns 
Group of 18 nations with major farming industries and a commitment 
to liberalizing agricultural trade. Vaile said he will discuss the 
state of farm trade negotiations with other members of the group over 
coming weeks and hopes to build political momentum for progress on 
trade reform. Australia is a major exporter of farm goods such as 
beef and wheat and has vigorously pushed for more liberal trade rules 
on agricultural products.

Allied warplanes and missiles blasted targets in Baghdad overnight, 
including Iraq's Olympic headquarters, where Saddam Hussein's son 
Odai is said to run a torture center. A steady series of explosions 
rumbled south of the capital Monday night and into Tuesday morning 
_ probably against Republican Guard positions _ after some of the 
strongest blasts in the capital since the war began March 20. Six 
explosions in rapid succession shook central Baghdad Monday night, 
sending smoke billowing from the Old Palace presidential compound 
and bathing the sky in a soft orange glow. Across the Tigris River, 
a target was hit in the city center less than a mile (a kilometer) 
from the Palestine Hotel, where many foreign journalists are staying. 
The 18-story hotel shook as if it had been struck by an earthquake. 
U.S. military officials said allied aircraft bombed a complex that 
serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee. Human 
rights activists have accused Saddam's son of jailing and torturing 
athletes. The lower four floors of the nine-story Olympic building 
were severely damaged. Walls were blown out, and mangled wire and 
steel protruded. The building sits in a big complex of housing units, 
and they appeared unscathed. Early Tuesday, American forces launched 
missiles toward Baghdad and the city of Karbala to the southeast. 
A huge explosion rocked the Old Palace compound shortly after 9 a.m. 
On Monday night, Saddam and sons Odai and Qusai appeared on Iraqi 
television, with the station showing footage of a meeting of top military 
commanders. There was no way of determining when the video was shot. 
Saddam decorated commanders and troops of army units in Umm Qasr, 
the Faw peninsula and Nasiriyah for their ``heroic'' defense of the 
areas, state television said. A communique read on Iraqi satellite 
television said members of the 11th Division, which fought in Nasiriyah, 
would receive medals and their families would get 2 million dinars 
_ about US$670. Saddam was last shown on Iraqi television Saturday 
night. Odai had not been seen on Iraqi TV since the war began, according 
to Al-Arabiya television. The Americans had hoped to cut off television 
and radio transmissions to halt Iraqi propaganda, but repeated bombings 
have largely failed to silence the broadcasts. Iraqi television was 
off the air for about three hours Monday morning. But the local media 
operation was ``as good as it was before'' the attacks, Information 
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf declared. Nearly all of Baghdad's 
telephone lines appeared out in the city of 5 million after at least 
five telephone exchanges were bombed. But the city's power supply 
remains intact and street lights came on at night. Coalition bombardments 
have focused recently on Republican Guard units protecting the approaches 
to Baghdad. The goal is to wear down Saddam's best-trained forces 
ahead of a U.S.-led ground assault on the capital.

The Chinese government's official news agency issued a call Tuesday 
to ``the world's overweight'': Come live on a dusty plateau in northwestern 
China and lose that annoying flab. ``The world's overweight could 
achieve significant weight loss through living in a low-oxygen plateau 
environment for a period of time,'' the Xinhua News Agency said. It 
quoted a Professor Gerili, director of what it called the Plateau 
Medical Research Center, but provided no other details. Calls to the 
Research Center for High Altitude Medicine at Qinghai Medical College, 
where a ``Gerili'' was listed as director, went unanswered Tuesday. 
Last year, the center surveyed 115 workers engaged in the construction 
of the Qinghai-Tibet railway on China's western Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, 
known as the ``world's roof.'' The survey showed an average weight 
loss of 10.2 percent of body weight after one month of hard work at 
an altitude of 4,000 meters (13,100 feet), Xinhua said. Gerili was 
quoted as saying that the people surveyed had been working normally 
and hadn't ``undergone especially intense exercise or diets of any 
kind.'' The results also indicated that those with more excess weight 
lost more weight in the plateau environment, Xinhua said. It cited 
what it called evidence that lack of oxygen assists weight loss. Gerili 
was quoted as suggesting that body building and weight-loss centers 
be built on the plateau _ where, according to Xinhua, ``obesity can 
be easily overcome through pleasant recreational activities and moderate 
physical exercise.'' China already has tried to put its loftiest areas 
to aerobic use, dispatching its Olympic runners to train at high altitudes 
in Tibet in hopes of increasing their lung capacity.

Japanese officials said North Korea test-fired a ground-to-ship missile 
on Tuesday, just days after Tokyo launched its first spy satellites 
into orbit to keep watch over the North's missile and nuclear programs. 
But South Korean officials, who initially called the reported launch 
``routine,'' later said there was no evidence it had actually occurred. 
There was no immediate explanation for the conflicting reports. Japanese 
officials said the reported missile posed no immediate security threat. 
``Since this is not a ballistic missile, we do not think that this 
would pose a direct threat to the security of Japan,'' Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Hatsuhisa Takashima said. He said it appeared to have flown 
toward the Yellow Sea, and not the Sea of Japan. Japan's satellite 
launch last Friday angered North Korea, which threatened to test-fire 
a missile. Tuesday's reported launch added to growing fears in Japan 
that the reclusive communist state might take advantage of the war 
in Iraq to escalate its missile and nuclear development. Officials 
from Japan's Defense Agency and Transport Ministry said North Korea 
had fired a short-range missile, with a range of about 60 kilometers 
(40 miles), from the northwestern coast of the Korean Peninsula. Koichi 
Furusho, chief of staff of the Maritime Self-Defense Forces, Japan's 
navy, said it was likely a routine test. He played down the possible 
dangers and told reporters that his forces were not placed on any 
special alert. In Washington, a Pentagon official confirmed the launch 
and said the United States does not view it as a threat. But South 
Korea's Defense Ministry later said there was no evidence that North 
Korea had test-fired a missile. ``South Korean and U.S. military intelligence 
officials have checked on the report and concluded that there was 
no missile launch by North Korea,'' a ministry official said on customary 
condition of anonymity. Japanese Foreign Ministry and Defense Agency 
officials were puzzled by the denial and said they had no such information. 
South Korea's new government, headed by President Roh Moo-hyun, has 
made strong efforts to reduce tensions with North Korea. The U.S. 
military announced Tuesday that U.S. stealth fighter jets and other 
aircraft and troops currently in South Korea for joint war games will 
remain after the exercises are finished to act as a deterrent against 
North Korea. In 1998, North Korea fired a long-range missile that 
flew over Japan and plunged into the Pacific Ocean. It is believed 
to possess missiles that could reach parts of the United States. North 
Korea test-fired two short-range missiles in late February and early 
March amid tensions over its suspected nuclear weapons programs. Washington 
and South Korea have criticized the tests as attempts to force the 
United States into direct talks. With the United States focused on 
the war in Iraq, some experts say North Korea might exploit the opportunity 
to test long-range missiles or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make 
atomic bombs. The Korean nuclear crisis flared last October, when 
U.S. officials said North Korea admitted having a nuclear program 
in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington and its allies suspended 
fuel shipments, and the North retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, 
withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting 
a nuclear reactor.

The United Nations food agency will ship flour to northern Iraq through 
Turkey to feed Iraqi Kurds who fled their houses fearing an attack 
by Saddam Hussein's forces, a spokeswoman said Tuesday. The World 
Food Program will send 1,000 metric tons of wheat flour on 60 trucks 
to northern Iraq on Wednesday from a warehouse in the southeastern 
city of Gaziantep, said Heather Hill. The agency sent 77 metric tons 
of powdered milk to the region from Turkey on Saturday. ``We're concerned 
about food supplies,'' Hill said. ``We want to make sure that people 
have enough food to eat.'' Thousands of Iraqi Kurdish residents have 
left cities and frontline towns to move toward the Turkish and Iranian 
borders, according to Iraqi Kurdish officials. Hill said the food 
shipments would be distributed near the northern Iraqi cities of Irbil, 
Dohuk and Sulaymaniyah. The agency has been stockpiling food in countries 
bordering Iraq to feed 900,000 refugees for 10 weeks. Tons of high-energy 
biscuits, chickpeas and vegetables oil are ready for shipment from 
Turkey. The United Nations appealed Friday for US$2.2 billion in emergency 
aid for Iraqis. The food program would use more than half of that 
money in the six months after the war to feed most of the country's 
population. ^ sh-ht

French counterterrorism experts are coming to Pakistan later this 
month to help the government in its battle against terrorism, a senior 
Interior Ministry official said Tuesday. ``The French team will help 
train our forensic experts,'' Brig. Javed Iqbal Cheema, the ministry's 
director general, told The Associated Press. ``They can also be helpful 
in training our anti-terrorism experts,'' he said. Pakistan's Interior 
Minister Minister Faisal Saleh Hayyat was in France last week for 
talks on increased cooperation, particularly in counterterrorism. 
Pakistan is a key ally in the U.S.-led war on terrorism next door 
in Afghanistan. Militants outraged by Pakistan's cooperation have 
staged several attacks against foreigners and Pakistani Christians. 
Among the victims were 11 French engineers, who were helping Pakistan 
build submarines. The engineers were killed in a suicide bombing last 
year in the southern city of Karachi.

Tourism in Asia is on the sick bed _ a casualty of war, disease and 
terror. Travel companies across the continent are watching with dismay 
the flood of cancellations in hotels and airlines, while worried governments 
brace for massive revenue losses. Tourism _ a pillar of most Asian 
economies _ plunged after the Sept. 11, 2001 Islamic terrorist attacks 
in the United States, which compelled nervous Americans and other 
foreigners to stay at home. Even more stayed away after 200 people, 
mostly foreign vacationers, were killed last October when two bombs 
ripped through a crowded nightclub district on the Indonesian resort 
island of Bali. Despite the carnage, there had been hopes that visitors 
will come back to the idyllic tropical beaches and the bustling bazaars 
of Asia. But now the travel industry has taken back-to-back hits -- 
the U.S.-led invasion on Iraq and the mysterious deadly flu-like disease 
that's spreading across the region and beyond. At least 62 people 
have died and 1,600 been stricken by severe acute respiratory syndrome, 
or SARS, on three continents with Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Vietnam 
and Canada being the worst-hit. ``These days threats to tourism come 
in all shapes and sizes. It could be microbes, terrorists or global 
leaders,'' said Imtiaz Muqbil, a Bangkok-based travel analyst. ``Tourism 
in Asia will probably go into a comatose state for a while. Whether 
it dies or revives will depend on how quickly the whole package of 
violence-terror-disease abates,'' said Muqbil, the editor of Travel 
Impact News Wire. Industry experts say the war on Iraq has virtually 
dried up the flow of Americans and Middle Easterners to Asia. And, 
while a majority of travelers in Asia are Asians, they too are now 
staying at home thanks to the SARS crisis, according to the Pacific 
Asia Travel Association, an apex body for the region's industry operators. 
``It is not the best situation. The real concern is how long, how 
hard the crisis will last and what would be the flow-on affects,'' 
said John Koldowski, PATA's chief strategic planner. The numbers being 
tallied by governments in Asia make for depressing reading -- tourist 
arrivals in Thailand dropped 10 percent in March compared with a year 
ago; Philippines reported a 4 percent drop in the first quarter of 
this year; about 50 percent of Malaysians booked on flights to China, 
Hong Kong and Vietnam before the SARS scare have canceled or postponed. 
No surprises here, given how widely the media are circulating the 
holiday-from-hell pictures and words -- surgical masks selling out 
in Beijing and Hong Kong; the Catholic church in Singapore no longer 
placing the Holy Communion wafer on the tongue; air travelers greeted 
at airports and in aircraft by staff wearing surgical masks; an entire 
apartment block quarantined in Hong Kong. The Rolling Stones rock 
band canceled concerts in Hong Kong and China. An international women's 
ice hockey tournament scheduled to begin this week in Beijing was 
also called off. Keum Gi-hyung of South Korea's tourism ministry said 
the number of inbound tourists is may have dropped 20 percent this 
month. The South Korean government has asked people to avoid nonessential 
travel to affected areas. Vietnam's biggest tour operator, Saigon 
Tourist, reported a 22 percent drop in foreign tourist business compared 
to last year. ``We have been hit hard by the SARS and the ongoing 
war in Iraq,'' said Nguyen Phuong Thien of Saigon Tourist. ``The tourism 
industry is clearly one of the most fragile and sensitive industries 
in the world. The impact of scare stories _ whether it is terrorism, 
war or viruses _ is just absolutely phenomenal. People are paranoid 
about their safety,'' said Muqbil, the travel analyst. A research 
by Thai Farmers Bank said the combined effect of the Iraq war and 
SARS could cut 30 billion baht (US$ 697 million) from Thailand's tourism 
revenue this year, earlier expected at 375 billion baht (US$ 8.7 billion). 
Growth in2003 tourist arrivals could drop to 1.9 percent from an earlier 
projection of 8.3 percent, it said. ``I believe it will hit not only 
us but the whole region,'' said Thailand's Tourism Minister Sontaya 
Kunplome. The Tourism Authority of Thailand said 50,000 tourists, 
mainly Europeans, have canceled their bookings for April and May. 
In response, the Thai Hotels Association agreed to slash room rates 
by 20 percent for a three-month period starting from April. Airlines 
are also feeling the pinch. Thai Airways announced on Monday it cut 
28 flights to some destinations while similar cuts were announced 
by Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific, Taiwan's China Airlines and Air India. 
Thai Airways stock price plunged 7.6 percent to a five month low on 
Tuesday. Qantas Airways said Monday it would reduce its domestic fares 
by up to 40 percent as more Australians decide to stay home while 
the war in Iraq continues. The corporate world is also avoiding traveling. 
``Travel to places like China, Vietnam and Singapore has definitely 
been curtailed. We are basically relying on video-conferencing and 
teleconferencing to keep in touch with our colleagues there,'' Emerson 
Electric India president Pradita Sen said. Countries that have been 
relatively untouched by SARS are making it known to the world, hoping 
to wean away undecided travelers to Singapore and Hong Kong. ``I want 
the world to know we don't have SARS,'' said Philippine Tourism Secretary 
Richard Gordon, urging people to visit his country. Muqbil, the analyst, 
says peace, stability, safety and good health have become a country's 
main tourism competitive advantage. ``Once upon a time the beauty 
of your country, the price of hotels, airlines, the quality of product 
were among the factors creating competitive advantage. Those days 
are gone, forever.'' Experts hope that the industry will regain health 
once the SARS virus has been contained and the war in Iraq finishes. 
``The fascinating thing is that the industry has shown its resilience 
time and time again. When stability is shown, the numbers rebound 
rapidly,'' said Koldowski, the PATA executive. ``These days for a 
vast majority of travelers international travel is no longer a luxury. 
It is a necessity.''

A veteran lawmaker from Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's conservative 
party became the nation's new agriculture minister Tuesday after his 
predecessor resigned over a bribery scandal. Yoshiyuki Kamei, a seven-term 
lawmaker from the Liberal Democratic Party, was appointed minister 
of agriculture, forestry and fisheries in a ceremony at Tokyo's Imperial 
Palace. ``I am fully aware of the heavy responsibility of this appointment,'' 
he told reporters. Kamei replaced Tadamori Oshima, who resigned Monday 
to take responsibility for allegations that an aide had accepted dubious 
political donations. Oshima was not personally implicated in the affair. 
But his resignation was another black mark for Prime Minister Junichiro 
Koizumi, who swept to power in 2001 on a reformist platform that included 
promises to make his party more transparent and accountable to voters. 
Two Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers have been arrested in money-related 
scandals since last year. Kamei, 66, formerly served as transport 
minister under then Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in 1996. He takes 
over the job at a time that Japan's farm policy is under fire from 
some of its trading partners. The Japanese government strongly opposes 
a proposal at the World Trade Organization to slash global tariffs 
on agricultural products, including Japanese rice imports. Farmers 
are among the most loyal supporters of Koizumi's party.

Burrowed in the sweltering desert, U.S. infantrymen ring a stark temple 
of a moon god and the sand-swept ruins of a city where 6,000 years 
ago civilization first budded and from which, it is said, three great 
religions blossomed. In the opening days of the war, U.S. forces drove 
through Ur, home to the Biblical Abraham and an ingenious population 
that irrigated fields, forged agricultural tools and devised the written 
word. The fighting, which continues in the nearby southern Iraq city 
of Nasiriyah, has so far spared the remains of Ur and the two families 
guarding them, who have worked as guides there for generations. ``We 
are proud,'' Dhief Nauos said Monday of his job as custodian of one 
of Iraq's greatest historic treasures. Five other men, standing outside 
two humble family compounds, nodded in agreement. But their immediate 
concerns were not about past glory, the lack of tourists, or even 
the war, but about their empty well and dwindling food stocks. Electric 
power also had been cut off. They have not been allowed into Nasiriyah, 
past roadblocks where U.S. troops try to ferret out soldiers in civilian 
clothes and hardline civilian supporters of the Iraqi regime. American 
units from the nearby Tallil Air Base have given them only 10 bottles 
of water, the men said. The two extended families _ 25 people, including 
15 children _ portrayed themselves as isolated from the ebb and flow 
of the conflict, harming nobody. ``We only love our country,'' said 
Dhief's 71-year-old father, Muhsen Nauos, committing himself to neither 
President Saddam Hussein nor the American forces surrounding him. 
Troops of the 141st Mechanized Infantry Battalion are spread out around 
the ruins, situated on a rise in the otherwise flat, rocky desert 
terrain that stretches to the horizon in every direction. The 4,000-year-old 
temple, a massive ziggurat of fired mud bricks, rises about 70 feet 
high, its fortress-like silhouette etched hard into the featureless 
landscape. A stairway on its eastern side led the ancient Sumerians 
toward heaven and closer to their moon god Nanna. Founded about 4,000 
B.C., Ur's golden age came from 2113 to shortly before 2000 B.C., 
when King Ur-Nammu expanded the Sumerian empire and made his capital 
the wealthiest city in Mesopotamia. Arts and literature flourished 
under his successors until enemies destroyed the city. By the 4th 
century B.C., Ur had all but faded into the desert, possibly because 
the Euphrates River, which once flowed near its walls and gave it 
profitable access to the sea, had shifted course. Both the Bible and 
the Quran, Islam's holy book, tell of Abraham's two sons migrating 
from the city, Isaac westward to Canaan to sire the Jewish race and 
through it Christianity. Ishmael headed to the Arabian peninsula to 
lay Islam's foundations. ``Abraham is the father of prophets. This 
is a sacred place to all religions,'' Dhief said in English learned 
from guiding foreign tourists in times of peace. Dhief, 44, said Ur 
attracted a steady flow of visitors from Europe, the United States 
and the Arab world until the 1991 Gulf War, when U.S. troops briefly 
occupied the area. Tourism fell to 75 percent of pre-war days but 
scientific excavation continued until about a month before the American 
attack. The ruins of Ur were discovered and first excavated by the 
British in the mid-19th century and their work continued until the 
1930s. Muhsen, a meagerly paid government civil servant, said his 
uncle had helped the British in the 1920s. From the desert sands, 
archaeologists resurrected the remains of a fortress and residential 
quarters, thousands of tablets in the cuneiform writing system and 
a royal cemetery dating to about 2600 B.C. containing treasures of 
gold, silver and precious metals. Evidence showed the death of the 
queen and king was followed by the suicides of their attendants, musicians 
and bodyguards. In 1961, said the caretakers, the ziggurat underwent 
a major facelift. The original inner core, which contained no chambers, 
was shored up with an outer brick wall, some 75 percent reconstructed 
from new material. Beneath these temple ramparts, Capt. Stanton Trotter, 
a U.S. army chaplain, spoke with an Iraqi interpreter attached to 
U.S. troops. They compared references to Ur and Abraham in the Bible 
and Quran. The interpreter, who had fled to the West, recalled how 
as a child, Jewish and Muslim families in his homeland had lived side 
by side in harmony. ``We Islamics and Jews are cousins and now we 
are fighting,'' said the interpreter, unleashing a stream of expletives 
about politicians.

WASHINGTON (AP) _ FBI officials are concerned that al-Qaida, with 
its ranks thinned and tactics exposed by a series of arrests, may 
turn to women to carry out surprise attacks, officials say. For the 
first time in the war on terror, the FBI has issued an alert for a 
woman, a Pakistani neurological expert, wanted for questioning in 
connection with al-Qaida. Analysts are also examining claims made 
by another woman in an Arabic newspaper that she was tasked by Osama 
bin Laden to open training camps for female terrorists. Female attackers, 
successfully used by other terror organizations like the Palestinian 
Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, would represent a major tactical shift for 
al-Qaida after years of being aligned with the Afghan Taliban regime 
that oppressed women and treated them as second class citizens unworthy 
of participating in the Islamic jihad, officials said. Several U.S. 
intelligence officials said they have no credible information suggesting 
there is an imminent attack plan to be carried out by women but that 
analysts are wary of the possibility. ``We're aware it is an option 
and one that was used recently against the Israelis and could easily 
be adapted by al-Qaida,'' one official said, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. FBI spokesman Mike Kortan said the bureau was constantly 
looking for trends to help prevent attacks. Several factors in the 
last month have led the FBI to prepare for the possibility that al-Qaida 
might turn to women. U.S. officials learned of an interview in the 
Asharq al Awsat newspaper based in London in mid-March in which a 
woman claimed al-Qaida was setting up training camps for female ``martyrs.'' 
The woman identified herself only as Umm Usama, which translates ``mother 
of Osama.'' ``We are building a women's structure that will carry 
out operations that will make the U.S. forget its own name,'' the 
woman claimed. She cited the success of Palestinian female suicide 
bombers used against Israel in recent months as an impetus for al-Qaida's 
planning. ``The organization thought about this before, but interest 
increased after the female martyr attacks in Palestine and Chechnya,'' 
the woman said. U.S. officials said while they had some suspicions 
about the interview because it was carried out across the Internet 
using chat rooms and e-mail, it illustrated that women are considered 
an option for future al-Qaida attacks. The FBI recently put out a 
global alert for 31-year-old Aafia Siddiqui and her estranged husband, 
Dr. Mohammed Khan, 33. It was the first time an FBI bulletin sought 
a woman since the war on terrorism began, officials said. The FBI 
said Siddiqui, who has a doctorate in neurological science from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, may be in Pakistan, but lived 
in Boston while attending MIT. FBI officials said they were not alleging 
she ``is connected to specific terrorist activities'' but that they 
wanted to question her about possible contacts with people under suspicion 
of terrorist activities. A third reason to suspect a tactical shift, 
FBI officials said, is that bin Laden's network has suffered several 
losses in its senior ranks and is aware documents and interrogations 
have yielded substantial information about its planning and tactics. 
In testimony last week, FBI Director Robert Mueller said more than 
212 suspected terrorists have been charged with crimes since Sept. 
11, 2001 _ 108 who already have been convicted. Several were on U.S. 
soil and in a position to launch attacks, officials said. The use 
of women in terrorist attacks is rare but not new. Young Palestinian 
women carried out four dramatic suicide bombings in Israel last year, 
completely foiling the military's security profiling and shaking both 
the Palestinian and Israeli populations. In 1991, Tamil Tigers fighting 
for independence in Sri Lanka used a woman, who detonated explosives 
strapped to her body, to assassinate Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi 
during a political rally.

Cuban officials were in tense negotiations at Havana's airport Tuesday 
with a man who claimed to have two grenades on a plane with 46 other 
people on board after he unsuccessfully tried to hijack it to the 
United States. The Cuban Airlines AN-24 was hijacked late Monday on 
a flight from Cuba's small Isle of Youth to Havana but was forced 
to land in the capital because it lacked sufficient fuel to make it 
to the United States, Cuban authorities said. Among those aboard were 
six children. At 2:45 a.m. EDT (0745 GMT), the twin-engine plane remain 
parked on the tarmac on a remote runway as negotiations continued. 
It would be extremely difficult for an average citizen to get access 
to grenades in communist-run Cuba, where such weapons are heavily 
guarded by the military. It was also unclear how anyone would be able 
to get a pair of grenades through the heavy security checks at Cuba's 
airports, especially less than two weeks after a successful hijacking 
on the same route of a passenger plane to the United States. All incoming 
and outgoing air traffic at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport 
appeared suspended during the negotiations. An Iberia Airlines flight 
to Madrid was grounded and photographers and cameramen at the scene 
said that they had seen no takeoffs or landings for several hours. 
A government statement released early Tuesday said the Soviet-made 
Cuban Airlines plane was on a regular passenger flight from the Isle 
of Youth's main city of Nueva Gerona when the pilot reported that 
the craft was being hijacked to the United States by a man armed with 
grenades. ``The Cuban authorities, for their part, will undertake 
the maximum effort to find a solution that preserves the safety and 
lives of passengers and crew members,'' said the statement. The statement 
blamed the hijacking attempt on what Havana says is the lax treatment 
that six other suspected hijackers received last month after successfully 
forcing another passenger plane from Cuba to Key West, Florida, at 
knifepoint. The suspects in the earlier successful hijack were charged 
with conspiracy to seize an aircraft by force and violence and face 
a minimum of up to 20 years in federal prison. They were granted bond, 
but remain behind bars because they have been unable to come up with 
the money. Cuban authorities were pleased that American officials 
decided to charge the six but were enraged last week when a federal 
judge decided to set bond over the objections of prosecutors. ``The 
entire responsibility of what could happen (in the latest hijack attempt) 
will fall on the government of that country,'' the Cuban statement 
said of the United States. In the successful hijacking, six crew members 
and 25 passengers were on a twin-engine Douglas DC-3 on the same route 
on March 19 when knife-wielding hijackers took control of the plane 
as it descended toward Havana after a trip from the Isle of Youth. 
They diverted the plane to Key West. The earlier hijack occurred as 
the U.S.-led war on Iraq was being launched. American fighter jets 
scrambled from Homestead Air Force Reserve Base and a U.S. Customs 
Black Hawk helicopter joined them to escort the blue and white plane 
to Key West. Sixteen of those aboard later opted to return to Cuba 
and the only non-Cuban on the flight, an Italian, was released in 
the United States. The rest of the passengers and crew members on 
that earlier flight opted to stay in the United States under a U.S. 
immigration policy that allows Cubans who reach American soil to stay 
and seek legal residency after a year.

DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ U.S. soldiers shot and killed at least seven Iraqi 
women and children at a checkpoint in southern Iraq in an episode 
that reflected the military's heightened anxiety over the danger of 
suicide attacks. The U.S. military said the soldiers opened fire Monday 
when the driver of the van failed to stop as ordered. An American 
journalist at the scene said 10 Iraqis in all were killed, including 
five young children. The soldiers were from the Army's 3rd Infantry 
Division, which lost four soldiers Saturday at another checkpoint 
when an Iraqi soldier posing as a taxi driver detonated a car bomb 
in a suicide attack. Elsewhere, the Central Command said, an Iraqi 
prisoner was shot to death after he reached for a Marine's weapon 
while being questioned. The fatal shooting at the checkpoint happened 
along Route 9 near Najaf, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of 
the site of Saturday's suicide bombing. The Central Command said initial 
reports indicated the soldiers followed the rules of engagement to 
protect themselves. ``In light of recent terrorist attacks by the 
Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint to avoid 
the unnecessary loss of life,'' the statement said. Navy Capt. Frank 
Thorp, a U.S. Central Command spokesman in Doha, blamed the deaths 
on the Iraqi regime's guerrilla tactics and its practice of using 
women and children as shields. ``The most horrendous thing about this 
is that this is the result of what is apparently the strategy of the 
regime to challenge us at checkpoints, which has caused us to be on 
our toes and ensure that these are not suicide bombers,'' he said. 
``So the blood of this incident is on the regime of Saddam Hussein.'' 
The shooting is likely to stoke opposition to the U.S.-led invasion 
among Iraqis in the Shiite Muslim region, where Washington had hoped 
for a popular uprising against Saddam and his Sunni Muslim regime. 
Instead, U.S. forces have faced stubborn resistance by Saddam's forces 
in Najaf and other southern Shiite strongholds. According to an account 
by the Central Command, the van approached the Army checkpoint Monday 
afternoon. Soldiers motioned for the driver to stop but were ignored. 
They then fired warning shots but the vehicle kept moving toward the 
checkpoint. Troops then shot into its engine. As a last resort, the 
military said, soldiers fired into the passenger compartment. Two 
other civilians were wounded, according to the U.S. military, which 
said it is investigating the incident. ``They tried to warn the vehicle 
to stop; it did not stop,'' Marine Gen. Peter Pace said on U.S. television 
channel PBS. ``And it was unusual that that vehicle would be full 
of only women and that the driver was a woman. So we need to find 
out why it was that they were acting the way they did.'' The military 
statement said 13 women and children were in the van. But The Washington 
Post, whose reporter is with the 3rd Infantry, said 15 people were 
in the vehicle and 10 were killed, including five children who appeared 
to be under 5. One of the wounded was a man not expected to live, 
the Post reported on its Web site. The newspaper described the vehicle 
as a four-wheel-drive Toyota crammed with the Iraqis' personal belongings. 
In its description of the shooting, the Post quoted a 3rd Infantry 
Division captain as saying the checkpoint crew did not fire warning 
shots quickly enough. The Post described the captain watching through 
binoculars and ordering the soldiers by radio to fire a warning shot 
first and then shoot a machine-gun round into the vehicle's radiator. 
When the vehicle kept coming, the captain ordered, ``Stop him!'' About 
a dozen shots of 25 mm cannon fire were heard from one or more of 
the platoon's Bradley fighting vehicles, the Post said. The captain 
then shouted over the radio at the platoon leader, ``You just [expletive] 
killed a family because you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough!'' 
according to the Post. ``It was the most horrible thing I've ever 
seen, and I hope I never see it again,'' Sgt. Mario Manzano, 26, a 
medic, told the Post. U.S. medics evacuated survivors of the shooting, 
according to the Post. A woman who had superficial head wounds was 
flown by helicopter to a U.S. field hospital when it was learned she 
was pregnant, the Post said. U.S. officials offered the victims an 
unspecified amount of money to compensate them.

Chinese authorities are recommending that doctors isolate patients 
suspected of having severe acute respiratory syndrome, disinfect anything 
patients touch and wear face masks during treatment, according to 
guidelines available Tuesday on the top disease-control agency's Web 
site. The recommendations, issued by the Chinese Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention, came after days of criticism of the country's 
communist government for its sluggish approach to the new illness, 
known as SARS. ``Hospitals must attach great importance to isolation 
work and disinfection,'' the government's guidelines say. Beijing-based 
officials from the World Health Organization said they were given 
the guidelines late Monday, but an official at the center who gave 
his name only as Mr. Zhou said they were posted Friday. More than 
1,600 people are believed infected with SARS worldwide, and 62 have 
died. Chinese officials last week acknowledged at least 34 deaths 
from the illness _ 31 of them in the southern province of Guangdong, 
where the disease is believed to have originated. Chinese officials 
have released little public information about the malady and have 
yet to begin providing daily updates on the disease as promised to 
WHO investigators who arrived in Beijing over a week ago. A WHO spokesman 
said Tuesday that investigators were also still awaiting permission 
to visit Guangdong where they hope to find clues into the disease's 
origin and spread. ``The Chinese government has not covered up. There 
is no need,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said Tuesday. 
``We have nothing to hide.'' Barely an hour later, a CNN satellite 
feed to an apartment compound housing foreigners in Beijing went black 
during a report on the illness _ something that has happened in the 
past when the news network reports about the banned Falun Gong spiritual 
movement or other stories that make the communist government uneasy. 
The 17 pages of detailed guidelines posted on the disease agency's 
Web site instruct hospitals to transfer patients suspected of having 
SARS to designated hospitals that have specialists in infectious diseases, 
respiratory problems and intensive care. Medical staff who interact 
with such patients should wear masks with 12 layers of fabric and 
protective caps, gloves and goggles. Anything patients touch _ including 
blood-pressure cuffs and ambulance equipment _ should be disinfected, 
the guidelines say. Hospitals are also told to disinfect the air in 
hallways, rest rooms, X-ray departments and other public spaces twice 
a day using spray disinfectant and, in some areas, germ-killing ultraviolet 
light. Local authorities were also told to improve ``scientific publicity'' 
to encourage the public to get early diagnosis and treatment, wash 
hands often and avoid crowded public areas such as cinemas. State-controlled 
newspapers and broadcasts monitored in Beijing made no mention Tuesday 
of the sickness. The central government's Health Ministry and local 
health authorities in Beijing, Guangdong and the northern province 
of Shanxi, where four cases have been reported, would say nothing. 
Despite the silence, many Chinese have learned about the disease from 
foreign broadcasts and the Internet. Pharmacies in Beijing are selling 
out of surgical masks and report swift sales of herbal remedies often 
credited with preventing infection. Already, organizers have canceled 
the women's world ice hockey championships, scheduled to begin in 
Beijing on Thursday. The Rolling Stones have also canceled concerts 
in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing due to concerns over the illness. 
On Saturday, the U.S. Centers of Diseases Control recommended travelers 
put off nonessential trips to mainland China. Medical staff at seven 
Beijing-area hospitals visited on Tuesday were wearing face masks, 
though hospital officials all either denied seeing SARS cases or refused 
to talk. Beijing United Family, a joint-venture hospital that serves 
the expatriate community, said in a posted notice that the hospital 
was ``closely watching the situation.'' Hospital officials said they 
have seen no cases of SARS, either at the hospital or within the larger 
expatriate community. ``We will remain vigilant, taking all necessary 
precautions,'' Dr. Sarah Borwein, head of the hospital's committee 
for handling potential SARS cases, said in a written statement. Hospital 
officials said they had been in frequent contact with government health 
authorities but refused to discuss details. A number of expatriate 
schools in Beijing have suspended classes out of concern, though schools 
in Guangdong's provincial capital of Guangzhou said they were staying 
open. ``Everyone here is healthy and no one is fearful,'' said a Chinese 
employee of the American International School of Guangzhou. She gave 
only her family name, Tang.

Japan can't yet confirm an earlier report from its military that North 
Korea test-fired a ground-to-ship missile, the top government spokesman 
said Tuesday. South Korean officials, who initially called the reported 
launch ``routine,'' later said there was no evidence it had occurred. 
``We have information about the missile but we have no confirmation,'' 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda told reporters. Japanese officials 
refused to disclose where they received the information, saying they 
were linked to security secrets. A Defense Agency official also backtracked 
from an earlier announcement by the Japanese navy's top official that 
North Korea had fired a short-range missile. The agency only had information 
about a launch, and no confirmation, he said on condition of anonymity. 
Earlier in the day, Japanese officials said North Korea fired a missile 
from the peninsula northwest coast into the Yellow Sea, although they 
said it posed no immediate security threat. In Washington, before 
Japanese officials reversed course on the missile announcement, a 
Pentagon official confirmed the launch and said the United States 
also did not view it as a threat. Japan last Friday launched two spy 
satellites into orbit to keep watch over the North's missile and nuclear 
programs, angering Pyongyang, which threatened to test-fire a missile. 
The initial report Tuesday of a launch by North Korea added to growing 
fears in Japan that the reclusive communist state might take advantage 
of the war in Iraq to escalate its missile and nuclear development. 
Earlier in the day, officials from Japan's Defense Agency and Transport 
Ministry said North Korea had fired a short-range missile, with a 
range of about 60 kilometers (40 miles), from the northwestern coast 
of the Korean Peninsula. Koichi Furusho, chief of staff of the Maritime 
Self-Defense Forces, Japan's navy, said it was likely a routine test. 
He played down the possible dangers and told reporters that his forces 
were not placed on any special alert. But South Korea's Defense Ministry 
later cast doubt on the announcement, saying there was no evidence 
that North Korea had test-fired a missile. ``South Korean and U.S. 
military intelligence officials have checked on the report and concluded 
that there was no missile launch by North Korea,'' a ministry official 
said on customary condition of anonymity. South Korea's new government, 
headed by President Roh Moo-hyun, has made strong efforts to reduce 
tensions with North Korea. The U.S. military announced Tuesday that 
U.S. stealth fighter jets and other aircraft and troops currently 
in South Korea for joint war games will remain after the exercises 
are finished to act as a deterrent against North Korea. In 1998, North 
Korea fired a long-range missile that flew over Japan and plunged 
into the Pacific Ocean. It is believed to possess missiles that could 
reach parts of the United States. North Korea test-fired two short-range 
missiles in late February and early March amid tensions over its suspected 
nuclear weapons programs. Washington and South Korea have criticized 
the tests as attempts to force the United States into direct talks. 
With the United States focused on the war in Iraq, some experts say 
North Korea might exploit the opportunity to test long-range missiles 
or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make atomic bombs. The Korean nuclear 
crisis flared last October, when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted 
having a nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington 
and its allies suspended fuel shipments, and the North retaliated 
by expelling U.N. monitors, withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and restarting a nuclear reactor.

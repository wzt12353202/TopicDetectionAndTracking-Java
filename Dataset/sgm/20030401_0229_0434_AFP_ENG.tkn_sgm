Jordanian authorities have arrested four Iraqis on suspicion of plotting 
to blow up a luxury Amman hotel frequented by US nationals and foreign 
journalists, diplomatic sources told AFP Tuesday. "Four Iraqis were 
arrested in Amman last week for their involvement in an attempt to 
blow up the Hyatt Amman Hotel", one of the sources told AFP asking 
not to be identified. Nearly 70 foreign journalists were staying in 
the hotel at the time of the plot, along with many Americans staying 
in two adjacent tower blocks. The reason for the Americans' presence 
in the Jordanian capital remains unclear. rh/kir Iraq-war-Jordan-attack

Japanese share prices closed slightly higher Tuesday on fresh demand 
associated with the new fiscal year, but with the upside capped by 
uncertainty over the duration of the war in Iraq, dealers said. The 
Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei 225 index ended the first day of the 
new Japanese financial year up 0.18 percent or 14.01 points at 7,986.72 
and the Topix index of all first section issues closed up 0.96 points 
at 788.96. "Yesterday, the local stockmarket was pressured by selling 
related to the end-March fiscal year account closure. But such selling 
eased today, the first day of the new fiscal year," said Kenji Karikomi, 
general manager at Hinode Securities. But Karikomi said the market 
failed to extend its gains because fears the US-led war in Iraq would 
be prolonged were still overhanging the market. "If overseas stockmarkets 
continue to fall due to the uncertainty of the duration of the war 
in Iraq, the local stockmarket will also continue to be pressured," 
he said. Dealers said the release of the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey 
showing a marginal deterioration in business confidence in the three 
months to March had little impact on the market as it was within expectations. 
"There was no surprise in the Tankan survey. Rather, investors were 
reacting to growing uncertainty over the war," said Hiroichi Nishi, 
senior market analyst at Nikko Cordial Securities. "The market took 
very calmly the outcome of the Tankan which contained no surprises," 
Kazumasa Fukushima, strategist at Toyo Securities said. But after 
the survey failed to provide fresh trading leads, "we had effectively 
no trading of any sort before us," Fukushima added. Banks ended lower 
due to the recent sharp decline in share prices leading to rising 
latent losses in their portfolios, with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial 
Group down 11,000 yen at 201,000 yen, Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group 
11,000 lower at 439,000, UFJ down 6,000 at 112,000, and Mizuho Financial 
Group losing 7,800 to 89,000. Karikomi said he did not expect banks' 
shares to be pressured much by concerns they will post further net 
losses for the year to March 2003 as such worries had been factored 
in. "The majority of the market participants knew that the latent 
securities losses of Japanese firms will increase -- that has been 
digested by the stockmarket," he said. Hi-techs were flat to lower, 
with Advantest 90 lower at 4,130 and Tokyo Electron down 60 at 4,580. 
Kyocera was flat at 5,880. Volume was estimated at 848 million shares. 
Decliners led gainers 711 to 634, with 161 stocks unchanged. bur-ja/dv

European stocks regained a little ground in early trading on Tuesday 
following sharp falls the previous day, bucking a downward trend on 
Wall Street overnight. The British FTSE 100 index of leading shares 
rose 0.8 percent to 3,642.0 points, the German DAX 30 index rebounded 
1.3 percent to 2,454.7 points and the French CAC 40 index rose 1.2 
percent to 2,649.9 points. The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index of leading euro-zone 
shares -- which had plunged 4.5 percent on Monday -- edged up 0.6 
percent to 2110.7. The rebound comes despite a slide for shares in 
New York on Monday, which saw the Dow Jones industrials average of 
30 top stocks drop 1.89 percent and the Nasdaq index decline just 
over two percent. Dealers there had taken fright at the prospect of 
a drawn-out, bloody war in Iraq, as well as a multi-billion dollar 
legal threat to tobacco giant Philip Morris USA, part of the Altria 
group. The news in Asia was mixed, with Hong Kong's key Hang Seng 
index dropping around one percent by Tuesday afternoon trading while 
Japanese prices closed 0.18 percent higher Tuesday on fresh demand 
associated with the country's new fiscal year. pw/hd Stocks-Europe

A killer pneumonia virus spreading around the globe and the US-led 
war against Iraq have caused a 20 percent fall-off in tourist arrivals 
to Cambodia, a senior government official said Tuesday. "So far, the 
number of tourists has decreased by around 20 percent compared to 
previous months," the tourism ministry's secretary of state Thong 
Khon told AFP. "This has been caused by the Iraq war and SARS leading 
to tourists worrying about their security and health," he said, referring 
to the atypical pneumonia, dubbed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 
which is sweeping the globe. SARS was causing greater unease than 
the war, Thong Khon said. The virus has killed at least 62 people 
and infected some 1,700 in 15 countries. Deaths have been recorded 
in mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Canada, Singapore and Thailand. 
There have been no reports of SARS infections in Cambodia. A number 
of tourists this month have cancelled their plans, said Meng Phala, 
secretary general for the Cambodia Association of Travel Agents. "Three 
or four out of every group of 15 or so tourists are cancelling their 
trips to Cambodia," he said, adding that his clients were mainly afraid 
of catching SARS by travelling in planes. The Grand Hotel d'Angkor 
in Siem Reap, the gateway town to the famed Angkor Wat temple complex, 
also reported cancellations. "Just 34 out of 131 rooms at the hotel 
have guests," receptionist Hong Paun said, adding that normally at 
this time of year 50 to 60 rooms would be filled. Health Minister 
Hong Sun Huot said at least three doctors were screening arrivals 
at Phnom Penh International Airport, with an ambulance standing by 
to carry anyone with SARS symptoms to Calmette Hospital for treatment. 
Screening was also taking place at other port and border checkpoints. 
Impoverished Cambodia is harbouring high hopes for tourism bringing 
in much-needed foreign exchange this year, targetting arrivals of 
one million on the back of a global "Visit Cambodia Year" campaign. 
Tourist arrivals jumped 30.6 percent in 2002 to 790,000. suy/sb/mlm/sdm/cl

The US army's elite 101st Airborne division stepped up its campaign 
around the central Iraqi city of Najaf on Tuesday, military officials 
said. The "Screaming Eagles" began the third day of their campaign 
to secure the areas south and north of the holy Shiite city by sending 
in another batallion of Apache attack helicopters to support infantry 
troops, division Aviation Brigade commander Colonel Greg Gass told 
AFP. Gass said the Apaches flew out early Tuesday to join a batallion 
of the smaller, less powerful Kiowa Warrior helicopters south of Najaf. 
The brigade's 3rd Batallion of Apaches resumed flights north of Najaf 
to also support 101st infantry troops who were fighting an unidentified 
Iraqi mechanized division, according to Gass. The 101st began its 
campaign around Najaf on March 30, with the primary aim to secure 
the area for communication and supply lines in the US military's push 
towards Baghdad. Najaf and Karbala, another city important to Iraq's 
majority Shiite population a further 80 kilometres closer to Baghdad, 
are vital to the US forces because important highways lead from there 
to the capital. Gass said he had no reports of the outcome of Tuesday 
combat by 10:00 am (0700 GMT). In Monday's battles, Gass said the 
3rd Batallion Apaches destroyed a "batallion's worth" of Iraqi soldiers 
and S-60 anti-aircraft 57mm weapons, without going into specific numbers. 
Gass described the combat as the heaviest his forces had been involved 
in since the start of the war on March 20. "They (the Iraqis) fought 
pretty hard from first light (into the afternoon)," Gass said, adding 
eight Apaches sustained various levels of damage. "Eight aircraft 
were hit anywhere from just a hole in the rotor to significant tail 
damage," Gass said. Gass and other 101st officers said that much of 
the small arms fire that had struck the helicopters orginated from 
behind houses and other buildings. kma/dab Iraq-war-Najaf-Airborne

A Cambodian court on Tuesday charged 13 Vietnamese with human trafficking 
and conspiracy in the sex trade following the dramatic rescue of 37 
girls from a notorious brothel village over the weekend. Phnom Penh 
Court Deputy Prosecutor Khut Sopheang said 13 alleged traffickers, 
six men and seven women, were formally charged by the prosecutor and 
will have their cases transferred to judges for further investigation. 
"If the court finds them guilty, they will be in imprisoned for 10 
to 20 years," Khut Sopheang told reporters. "They will be temporarily 
sent to jail, awaiting trial in the next four to six months," he said. 
Sopheang said one of the 13 would face an additional charge of drug 
trafficking, for which he could face an extra one to five years in 
jail, because police had found amphetamine pills in his house. The 
suspects were arrested and the girls rescued in a weekend operation 
in Svay Pak village, 11 kilometers (seven miles) north of the capital 
Phnom Penh, by dozens of Cambodian and American police. The major 
raid followed several months of investigations by a US Christian humanitarian 
group, International Justice Mission (IJM). Ten girls aged between 
five and 10, and 27 girls aged between 10 and 16 were rescued. Police 
had earlier said more than 20 were aged under ten, but their age had 
been determined after interviews, Sopheang said. The girls were being 
treated as victims of trafficking for sex and had been handed to the 
IJM, who were working closely with a coalition of non-governmental 
organisations on assessing their situation. Svay Pak, often dubbed 
K11, has earned a horrific reputation as a black hole of child-trafficking 
and sexual exploitation. The collection of concrete houses along a 
dirt road is home to hundreds of sex workers, the majority of them 
Vietnamese who service foreign and Cambodian clientele for as little 
as three dollars each. In January, police conducted a similar raid 
on the infamous area, aiming to shut it down for good, but no arrests 
were made and brothel operations quickly resumed. rs/sb/sdm Cambodia-childsex

International news agency Agence-France Presse and US-based photograph 
agency Getty Images have signed a strategic partnership agreement, 
the companies announced Tuesday. Under the agreement, Getty Images 
will have exclusive rights to market AFP images in North America and 
Britain. Paris-based AFP will market Getty Images photographs from 
North America throughout the rest of the world, the companies said 
in a joint statement. The deal is expected to be implemented during 
the second quarter of this year, the statement said. "We believe that 
this agreement is to the benefit of all -- allowing Getty Images to 
expand our reach, AFP to optimize its resources, and customers to 
receive a truly rich and comprehensive news photography product," 
Getty Images chief executive Jonathan Klein said in the statement. 
Getty Images works with more than 250 staff and freelance photographers 
around the world who produce between 700 and 1,000 photos each day. 
AFP is an international news agency offering services in eight languages. 
Its international news photo service, launched in 1985, has more than 
300 staff photographers and hundreds of freelancers and produces some 
1,000 news photographs per day. "The agreement is of major important 
for AFP," AFP's chief executive Bertrand Eveno said in the statement. 
"Getty's superb coverage of North America, including sports and celebrities, 
is the perfect complement and will strengthen AFP's position as a 
major actor in photo news, servicing top newspapers worldwide," he 
said. bur-yad/gl France-US-media-AFP-Getty

Four Islamic militants and an activist of India's main opposition 
party were killed in separatist-related violence in restive Indian-administered 
Kashmir overnight, a police spokesman said Tuesday. He said Ghulam 
Mohammed Sheikh of the Congress party was shot dead at his home by 
suspected Muslim rebels in the Kreeri area of the northern Baramulla 
district late Monday. Sheikh is the second political activist to have 
been shot dead in the last two days in Baramulla. A ruling Peoples 
Democratic Party (PDP) worker was shot dead by suspected rebels on 
Sunday. The PDP and Congress swept the long-ruling National Conference 
from power in state elections in September-October last year. Rebels 
have targeted activists of both parties since the polls. Meanwhile, 
Indian troops shot dead four militants in two gun battles in the southern 
district of Anantnag late Monday. Three of the four militants were 
killed in Kapran village, near Kulgam township, 70 kilometres (44 
miles) south of the summer capital Srinagar, the spokesman said, adding 
some arms and ammunition were also recovered. The Indian security 
forces say over 38,000 people have died in Kashmir since the eruption 
of anti-Indian rebellion in 1989, but separatists put the toll twice 
as high. str/an/sdm/pch India-Kashmir-unrest

Nearly two-thirds of Britons think the US-British war against Iraq 
is going well, according to a poll published in The Times newspaper 
on Tuesday. The Populus poll, taken last weekend, showed that nearly 
two thirds of Britons think the war "will have been justified only 
if it produces proof that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction and 
more than four in five say that the war will have succeeded only if 
(Iraqi) President Saddam Hussein is captured or killed," The Times 
said. Britons also said they were resigned to the war lasting several 
months. A US poll released Monday found that 70 percent favor the 
war on Iraq while 27 percent oppose it. The Gallup poll was conducted 
Saturday and Sunday for USA Today and CNN. In France, a poll published 
in Le Monde newspaper Monday said that just over half of the French 
public wants a victory for the US-British alliance. Fifty-three percent 
of respondents answered yes when asked if they wanted "deep-down a 
victory for the US and the English," against 33 percent who said they 
did not and 14 percent who gave no response, according to the IPSOS 
survey. Seventy-four percent felt that President Jacques Chirac had 
not "gone too far in his opposition to the US," against 23 percent 
who thought he had. bur/msa/yad Iraq-war-Britain-poll

Radical student organisers vowed Tuesday to stage an anti-war rally 
in central Sydney on Wednesday, despite a police ban imposed after 
a similar protest last week turned violent. The Books Not Bombs (BNB) 
national coalition said its members would "defend to the death their 
fundamental democratic right to march the streets". Police refused 
to grant a march permit, fearing a repeat of last week's violence 
which ended with 33 youths arrested and four police injured after 
they were pelted with chairs, bottles and marbles. The march was organised 
for high school students opposed to the war in Iraq but police said 
"a large group of Middle Eastern males" turned up intent on causing 
trouble. BNB spokeswoman Kylie Moon said her organisation wanted a 
peaceful protest and was determined to exercise its right to free 
speech under international laws. "They threaten our right to speak 
out against the war but we will not be silenced," Moon said. Mainstream 
peace groups have distanced themselves from BNB, which the New South 
Wales (NSW) state government claims has links to anarchist and socialist 
organisations dedicated to violent direct action. But the group has 
blamed heavy-handed police tactics for last week's violence and threatened 
to launch a class action against authorities in NSW. Moon said legal 
observers and marshalls would be posted throughout the protest route 
tomorrow to monitor police behaviour. ns/rcw Iraq-war-demos-Australia

South Korean share prices rose 0.53 percent Tuesday as retail bargain-hunting 
offset early weakness triggered by losses on Wall Street amid concerns 
over the Iraq war, dealers said. The composite index closed up 2.86 
points at 538.56. Volume was 519 million shares worth 1.7 trillion 
won (1.35 billion dollars). "It was just a brief break on the steep 
downhill slope," Sejong Securities market analyst Yoo Ji-Sang said, 
referring to the rebound from the 3.71 percent plunge on Monday. Yoo 
noted that foreign investors continued to curtail down their holdings 
in the local bourse. "As the Iraq war is unlikely to end soon, investors 
have begun to be concerned about a very late economic recovery." Yoo 
said, adding that support at the 500-point level appeared vulnerable 
again. Rising stocks led falls by 449 to 292 with 76 unchanged. Foreign 
investors were net sellers of shares worth 190.2 billion won, institutional 
investors net sellers of shares worth 83.0 billion and retail investors 
net buyers of shares worth 269.0 billion. Samsung Electronics closed 
unchanged at 284,000 won. SK Telecom added 5,500 to 158,500 and KT 
closed up 950 at 44,200. bur/jkw/dv Stocks-SKorea-close

Jordan supected Iraqi diplomats whom it expelled last month of plotting 
to poison water supplies serving military bases near the Iraqi border 
used by US service personnel, diplomatic sources said Tuesday. "The 
Iraqi diplomats expelled on March 23 were conspiring to poison water 
mains serving the east of Jordan," where most of the US forces deployed 
in the kingdom are based, one of the sources told AFP, declining to 
be identified. The source did not elaborate on the nature of the poison 
said to have been involved in the plot. Jordan originally expelled 
five embassy staff but later lifted the expulsion order against two 
of them. King Abdullah II also made clear the following day that Jordan 
was ready to allow Iraq to name replacements for those kicked out.

France's Manchester United defender Mikael Silvestre says players 
have become pawns in the hands of the football money men out to exploit 
them. Silvestre, in Sicily for France's Euro 2004 qualifier against 
Israel on Wednesday, says the Confederations Cup in France in June 
denies players their one chance in the year to take a break. "There 
comes a time when the body cries 'Stop'," he told l'Equipe sports 
daily. "It's the only period where we can really rest." But he said 
a potential battle between clubs and national federations over releasing 
players for the tournament was out of the hands of players. "If the 
clubs, to protect their players, want to take on the federations, 
they will," he said "But the international players will be suspended. 
For us, what's important is the French national team. The players 
won't rebel but the decision-makers are more important than us. "We're 
the pawns of the managers and administrators. We're just merchandise. 
It's as simple as that. Everybody tries to get as much as they can 
for their own interests." Arsenal chief executive David Dein warned 
last month that if there was not a radical re-drawing of the international 
calendar within the next 12 months the simmering club-versus-country 
row would degenerate into all-out conflict. "We pay the players. We 
are in command of the players' salaries. They work for us first and 
foremost," Dein told BBC TV. "We're happy to release them but it's 
a question of balance. There has to be a total revolution in the fixture 
calendar. Otherwise the clubs will say we're not going to release 
our players." The first big test comes in the Confederations Cup in 
France. FIFA has called on Europe's top clubs to release their players 
for the June 18-29 tournament But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has 
already said his French stars Thierry Henry, Silvain Wiltord, Robert 
Pires and Patrick Vieira need a break from football. And Real Madrid 
president Florentino Perez said that if Real was still in the running 
for their domestic title then he would not release Brazil World Cup 
stars Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos and French stars Zinedine Zidane 
and Claude Makelele for the start of the tournament. rw03 Fbl-FRA-Silvestre

Japanese hi-tech giant Fujitsu and US computer chip maker Advanced 
Micro Devices said Tuesday they will combine their flash memory chip 
operations to create the world's second largest flash memory firm 
after US chip giant Intel. Fujitsu and AMD will set up a joint venture, 
FASL LLC, in September in California to integrate their flash memory 
chip businesses. AMD will own a 60 percent stake in the firm with 
the rest taken by Fujitsu, the two said in a statement. "We are putting 
our flash memory operations under one company and we believe it will 
help us become more competitive in the global market," said Yuichi 
Ikeda, a spokesman for Fujitsu. The new company will be capitalized 
at one billion dollars and sales are targetted at 1.5 billion dollars, 
the business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun said Tuesday. Fujitsu declined 
to confirm the figures. The new company will employ some 7,000 staff 
from the two firms and its board of directors will comprise six AMD 
members and four from Fujitsu, the statement said. Fujitsu and AMD 
already collaborate in the flash memory chip business after setting 
up an equally owned joint venture in Japan in 1993. Haruo Sato, a 
semiconductor analyst at Tokai-Tokyo Research Center, said the integration 
was vital to both companies' survival in the fiercely competitive 
flash memory market. "Chip makers are struggling with a global economic 
downturn and a continued fall in prices," Sato said. "It is the same 
case as with DRAMs (dynamic random access memory chips) in that only 
five top companies can survive in the flash memory market. Before 
it is too late, the two want to secure the number two spot in the 
global market," the analyst said. Flash memory chips can retain data 
even when the power is off. They are an integral part of most electronic 
devices including mobile phones and digital cameras. Shares in Fujitsu 
rose five yen or 1.6 percent to close at 325 yen Tuesday. shi/ja/dv

South Korea posted a trade deficit for the third straight month Tuesday, 
signalling lean times for the economy as growth targets succumb to 
a rising tide of gloom. The Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry 
said the country's customs-cleared trade account was 362 million dollars 
in the red last month, due to higher oil import costs amid the war 
in Iraq. The deficit was in a sharp contrast with the same month a 
year ago when South Korea reaped a trade surplus of 1.26 billion dollars. 
For the three months to March, the trade account showed a 840 million 
dollar accumulated deficit with the shortfalls of 375 million dollars 
of February and 102 million dollars of January. "The trade account 
has recorded three straight months of shortfalls as imports are growing 
at a faster rate on higher oil prices," the ministry said in statement. 
"But it could turn to a surplus again should oil prices fall to below 
30 dollars, even if the US-led war against Iraq is prolonged." A third 
month of trade deficit is the latest in a catalogue of bad news affecting 
South Korea's economy. Stock prices continue to fall, consumer confidence 
tumbled to a 18-month low on Monday, consumer prices rose at the fastest 
pace in more than two years in March. Economists say this year's economic 
growth will fall well below four percent, compared with last year's 
performance of 6.2 percent. The economists warned that even a quick 
end to the war in Iraq might not lead to an early rebound of the South 
Korean economy. They cited the mounting stand-off over North Korea's 
nuclear programme and looming labor confrontations as factors that 
could undermine investment. To make the matters worse, a high-profile 
accounting fraud case involving SK Global, a trade arm of the country's 
third largest business group, the SK Group, has brought further instability 
to financial markets. The accounting fraud compounded the liquidity 
crunch faced by the country's credit card companies, many of which 
are owned by banks. Maturing bonds and commercial papers issued by 
the card companies are not being rolled over amid mounting redemption 
calls on bonds as most credit card firms reported losses this year 
due to a sharp rise in delinquencies and a cut in commissions. A senior 
official of the Ministry of Finance and Economy said the government 
will convene a meeting of policy makers from later this week to address 
concerns over a liquidity crunch faced by credit card companies. Mounting 
debts owed by credit card companies, including bonds issued by them, 
which stood at 89 trillion won (7.1 billion dollars) as of December 
last year, have emerged as a main source of jitters in the financial 
markets. Byeon Yang-Ho, director of financial policy division at the 
Finance and Economy Ministry, said the government will convene the 
meeting to discuss measures aimed at easing concerns over credit card 
companies. "Of the debts owed by credit companies, there are little 
problem debts," Byeon said, adding that the companies have run little 
risks of going insolvent. "We need to take some measures to assure 
the markets that these companies are viable, to enhance their profitability 
and ease the short-term liquidity crunch," he said. ckp/cw/dv SKorea-economy

Indonesia's human rights record remained poor last year and serious 
abuses continued, the US State Department said. "Soldiers and police 
murdered, tortured, raped, beat and arbitrarily detained both civilians 
and members of separatist movements," the department said in the Indonesia 
section of its worldwide human rights report released Monday. It singled 
out the armys special forces Kopassus and the Brimob police paramilitary 
unit for particular censure. Abuses by security forces were most apparent 
in Aceh province where some 898 fighters and civilians were killed 
during the year, the report said. The State Department also criticised 
the separatist Free Aceh Movement rebels, saying they had killed, 
tortured, raped, beat and illegally detained civilians and members 
of the security forces during 2002. Security force members also committed 
severe abuses in other conflict zones such as Papua, the Maluku islands 
and Central Sulawesi "but at reduced levels compared with the previous 
year." The State Department rapped a human rights court, which was 
set up following the army-backed militia violence against independence 
supporters in East Timor in 1999. The court had acquitted 10 security 
force members and a civilian as of end-March. Five people -- two army 
officers, a former Dili police chief, the former civilian governor 
and an ex-militia chief -- had been ordered jailed. All are free pending 
appeals. "The tribunals performance (as of year-end) reinforced the 
impression that impunity would continue for soldiers and police who 
committed human rights abuses," the State Department said. It said 
the government's failure to meet statutory deadlines in preparing 
cases for the court "represented a major procedural violation that 
could provide grounds to overturn convictions on appeal." The report 
noted a reduced death toll in most conflict zones but said the government 
"largely failed to deter social, inter-ethnic and inter-religious 
violence." Mob vigilante action and religious groups purporting to 
uphold public morality continued to dispense "street justice," it 
said. Widespread corruption continued throughout the legal system 
with bribes influencing prosecution, conviction and sentencing. The 
report noted that the government had passed a child protection act 
and related legislation. "However, child labor and sexual abuse remained 
major problems and implementation of the law remained weak." People-trafficking, 
particularly for prostitution, remained a significant problem, the 
State Department said. sm/rcw US-rights-Indonesia

BAGHDAD, April 1 (AFP) - US-British forces bombarded the main presidential 
palace complex in the Iraqi capital on Tuesday morning for the second 
consecutive day, an AFP reporter said. A plume of smoke rose into 
the air after a missile or smart bomb crashed into the heart of the 
compound on the 13th day of the war around 9 am (0600 GMT). Baghdadis 
however continued to move around the city as they have throughout 
the conflict. After a night of relative calm, heavy bombing resumed 
around 10:10 am (0710 GMT) on the southern outskirts of Baghdad, the 
reporter added. The sprawling palace grounds, a potent symbol of President 
Saddam Hussein's grip on power, has been a frequent target of the 
bombardments and was struck twice on Monday. During the afternoon 
a warplane buzzed the compound, the largest of eight presidential 
palaces in the capital, and launched a missile which was followed 
by two more strikes in the evening. Around a dozen missiles had struck 
the Iraqi capital overnight. The US Central Command said in a statement 
that coalition forces had used "precision-guided munitions to target 
a regime office complex in eastern Baghdad" at around 11:30 pm (1930 
GMT) on Monday. The office complex served as an office location for 
regime leaders and housed the youth ministry and the Iraqi National 
Olympic Committee, chaired by Saddam's elder son Uday, Centcom said. 
"The strike was executed to erode the command and control capabilities 
of regime leaders," it said, adding that battle assessment was ongoing.

South Korea issues state bonds to prop up falling money market rates 
ATTENTION - UPDATES with govt mulling market stabilization measures 
/// SEOUL, April 1 (AFP) - South Korea's central bank on Tuesday put 
four trillion won (3.2 billion dollars) worth of bonds on the auction 
block as part of efforts to shore up money market rates amid slackening 
economic activity. The central Bank of Korea is believed to have offered 
extra yields of somewhere between one and two basis points (0.01 to 
0.02 percentage points) on top of market rates for the monetary stabilization 
bonds. "Our survey showed most of the bonds will be digested in the 
market at the level of the yields we expect to offer," a BoK official 
said. Three-year benchmark state bond yields on Monday closed down 
another 0.06 percentage points at 4.62 percent, and the three-year 
corporate bond yield was down 0.02 at 5.38 percent. Tuesday's issuance 
of monetary stabilization bonds underscored a new urgency for market 
stabilization measures as bad news continued to affect South Korea's 
economy. Stock prices continue to fall, consumer confidence tumbled 
to a 18-month low on Monday, consumer prices rose at the fastest pace 
in more than two years in March, while economists say this year's 
economic growth will fall well below four percent, compared with last 
year's performance of 6.2 percent. The economists warned that even 
a quick end to the war in Iraq might not lead to an early rebound 
of the South Korean economy. They cited the mounting stand-off over 
North Korea's nuclear programme and looming labor confrontations as 
factors that could undermine investment. Meanwhile, a senior official 
of the Ministry of Finance and Economy said the government would convene 
a meeting of policy makers this week to address concerns over a liquidity 
crunch faced by credit card companies. Mounting debts owed by credit 
card companies, including bonds issued by them, which stood at 89 
trillion won (7.1 billion dollars) as of December last year, have 
emerged as a main source of jitters in the financial markets. Byeon 
Yang-Ho, director of financial policy division at the Finance and 
Economy Ministry, said the government will convene the meeting as 
early as Wednesday to discuss measures aimed at easing concerns over 
credit card companies. "Of the debts owed by credit companies, there 
are little problem debts," Byeon said, adding the companies have run 
no risk of going insolvent. "We need to take some measures to assure 
the markets that these companies are viable, to enhance their profitability 
and ease the short-term liquidity crunch," he said. Most credit card 
firms reported losses this year due to a sharp rise in delinquencies 
and a cut in commissions. ckp/dv SKorea-economy-bonds

A man with two hand grenades is holding an airliner with 46 people 
on board hostage at Havana's international airport, demanding that 
he be flown to Miami, officials said early Tuesday. The Soviet-made 
AN-24 airliner was en route from Nueva Gerona to Havana when the hijacker 
ordered the crew to head for Miami but had to land at Jose Marti International 
Airport because it had insufficient fuel, officials said in a statement. 
The airliner is currently parked on the tarmac, surrounded by police, 
as authorities "do their utmost to seek a solution that ensures the 
safety and lives of the passengers," the statement added. The hijacker 
aboard the plane is threatening to detonate both his hand grenades 
if his demand to be flown to Miami is not met, it added. The plane 
was hijacked Monday at around 9:30 pm (0130 GMT Tuesday) after taking 
off from Nueva Gerona, on the Island of Youth some 150 kilometers 
(93 miles) south of the capital, the statement said. The airplane 
is carrying 40 adults, including the crew, and six children, the official 
statement said. "This act (of piracy) is the direct result of the 
encouragement US authorities have given hijackers with their incomprehensible 
behavior in the wake of the March 19 hijacking of a (Cuban) DC-3 airliner 
to the United States by six terrorists armed with knives," the Cuban 
official statement said. "The responsibility for what will happen 
(with Monday's hijacking) will fall entirely on the government" of 
the United States, the statement added. The Cuban statement referred 
to the March 19 hijacking to Florida of another Cuban airliner with 
33 people on board after it also flew out of the Island of Youth. 
That plane was forced to land by US warplanes in Key West, Florida's 
southernmost island, where the hijackers were taken into custody. 
Eleven of the passengers sought political asylum in the United States; 
the rest returned to Cuba. A US judge later ruled that the six hijackers 
could be released on a 25,000 dollar bond pending trial, but the decision 
is pending an appeal by federal lawyers. Cuban President Fidel Castro 
criticized the judge's decision and asked if the United States planned 
to put the six hijackers in a "gilded cage," wondering how their treatment 
would compare with the spartan conditions meted out to al-Qaeda and 
Taliban members confined at the US base in Guantanamo, Cuba. Cuba 
has also been critical of the US policy of granting asylum to any 
Cuban who manages to set foot on US soil -- like the 11 passengers 
on the March 19 flight. Those intercepted on the high seas are returned 
to the communist island. fgf/jlp Cuba-plane

American Airlines has reached deals with three main unions that would 
allow 1.8 billion dollars in contract cost reductions, staving off 
a threatened bankruptcy. "By taking these decisive actions, the union 
leadership and our employees have demonstrated an unwavering commitment 
to the future of the company, and have enabled us to avoid an immediate 
filing with the bankruptcy court," the company's chairman Don Carty 
said in a statement late Monday. The world's largest airline asked 
all employees, including management, for a total of 1.8 billion dollars 
in permanent, annual savings to help save the struggling and debt-ridden 
company and position the airline to compete more effectively in the 
future. The results of that effort came a day after the Allied Pilots 
Association announced its proposal meeting American Airlines' targets 
for 660 million dollars in contract cost reductions. Additional cuts 
in costs for the airline amount to 340 million dollars from flight 
attendants, 620 million from workers represented by the Transport 
Workers' Union, 80 million dollars from agents, representatives and 
planners, and some 100 million dollars from management and support 
staff. American Airlines had said in a statement Sunday that, "Face-to-face 
negotiations continue around the table, around the clock with the 
mechanics, flight attendants and pilots." The company also said that 
company chairman Carty would take a 33 percent base pay cut, decline 
a bonus for the third year, and ask the board of directors to significantly 
reduce the value of his and his senior officers compensation packages. 
American employees will have access to a new stock option and profit 
sharing program. The deal still needs approval from the unions' memberships. 
The company also needs to secure "meaningful concessions" from its 
vendors, lessors and suppliers, Carty said. "The financial condition 
of American is weak and its prospects remain uncertain," the company 
said in communications with its employees. "Particularly given the 
impact of the continuing war in Iraq and the different general economic 
conditions that are negatively impacting the industry, the days ahead 
will be difficult and the success of our joint efforts is not yet 
assured." "I would not ask for these sacrifices if I weren't convinced 
that they were absolutely necessary to achieve our restructuring goals," 
Carty said. American Airlines is only one of many US airlines in severe 
financial difficulties amid a general economic downturn and a slump 
in air travel following the September 11 attacks. The number two carrier 
United Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection late last year. And 
US Airways announced Monday its emergence from seven months of bankruptcy, 
after slashing 1.9 billion dollars a year in annual costs under bankruptcy 
court superviusion. US Airways had secured 1.24 billion dollars in 
financing to boost its liquidity, allowing it to meet its goals. But 
the airline went on to immediately warn of a new airline crisis triggered 
by the Iraq war. "We have taken very difficult -- some would even 
say impossible -- steps to restructure our company and lower our costs," 
US Airways president and chief executive David Siegel said in a statement. 
"But government imposed costs continue to strangle this industry, 
and the war's direct impact has been substantial," he warned. "I am 
very hopeful that Congress will respond with appropriate relief for 
the losses airlines are suffering because of the war and more stringent 
security requirements," he said. The US airline industry last week 
appealed for some four billion dollars in government aid, saying the 
outbreak of the Iraq war and terrorism fears had pounded air travel.

Scotland's Colin Montgomerie has withdrawn from this week's BellSouth 
Classic in Atlanta after a poor six weeks in the USA and has returned 
home to "recharge his batteries". He made only one cut, at the Bay 
Invitational, and failed by one shot to qualify for the last two rounds 
at the Players Championship. "He is disappointed to let down the BellSouth 
Classic, but he just wants to recharge his batteries," his manager 
Guy Kinnings told BBC Online. "Monty wants to spend some time working 
on his game. "He has spent a lot of time in America and believes it 
would be better to be at home for a week, before flying back out for

Growth in the Philippines' key electronics sector will be mild this 
year due to the Iraq war and other uncertainties, but the pace should 
double in 2004 as the world replaces ageing equipment and gadgets, 
officials said Tuesday. Industry officials projected electronics exports 
to grow by 10 percent to 26.68 billion dollars, a percentage point 
less than its 2002 result, before shipments pick up by 20 percent 
next year to 32.02 billion dollars. Electronics products account for 
69 percent of Manila's merchandise exports and about 24.15 percent 
of the gross national product, official figures show. "We're considering 
this year as a mild year," with "no major investments" and "no major 
hirings", said Ernie Santiago, executive director of the 202-member 
Semiconductor and Electronics Industries of the Philippines Inc. (SEIPI). 
He told an industry briefing that electronics sector investment in 
the Philippines would be flat at about one billion dollars annually 
over the next two years. "I don't think the length of the conflict" 
will be a factor "as long as it is confined in that area and it will 
not create problems like terrorism," said Norberto Viera, president 
and managing director of the Philippine unit of US firm Texas Instruments. 
"If they don't start bombing in other places or impede the movement 
of goods I think we would be okay." "I think we'll still be able to 
see between 11 and 15 percent (export growth) barring any major incident," 
he added. "We are very bullish of the industry primarily because of 
the success of the wireless gadgets," said Viera, whose company provides 
at least 95 percent of all the digital signal processors or brains 
of mobile telephone maker Nokia. "As a matter of fact the demand for 
these products is so hot that in our factory back in Baguio (city) 
we are running at full capacity," Viera said. Nokia of Finland has 
a 35 percent share of the mobile phone handset business. Viera said 
Texas Instrument Philippines' turnover this year should rise to between 
2.3 and 2.5 billion dollars compared with 2.2 billion dollars last 
year. The amount is equivalent to the total shipments of the garments 
industry, the Philippines' number-two export product. A spokesman 
for Integrated Microelectronics Inc., a major Filipino-owned electronics 
manufacturing subcontractor, said its revenues should rise by between 
8.0 and 10 percent this year, from 82 million dollars in 2002. Santiago 
said the Filipino electronics sector was initially looking at a burst 
of global technology spending in 2003 to provide a complete recovery 
from a minus 20 percent export plunge in 2001. "But because of some 
uncertainties, the Iraq war, it was delayed and we're looking at next 
year," he said. cgm/jvg/dv Philippines-IT-company-forecast

Munich Re, the world's biggest insurer, is planning to issue a 20-year 
bond in mid-April to bolster its financial position, a company spokesman 
said on Tuesday. The spokesman did not reveal any details regarding 
the size of the issue, but the newspapers Sueddeutsche Zeitung and 
Financial Times Deutschland reported it would raise an estimated three 
billion euros (3.3 billion dollars). The spokesman said it would be 
denominated largely in euros, but Munich Re was also considering issuing 
part of it in other currencies. Munich Re would have the right to 
call in the bond after a minimum of 10 years. The reinsurance giant 
urgently needs to bolster its finances after it was forced to write 
down its share portfolio to the tune of 5.7 billion euros last year. 
However, the stock markets seem to be sceptical that a bond issue 
will be sufficient to replenish the group's financial reserves and 
Munich Re shares have lost about a third of their value in about a 
week. On Tuesday, however, they were enjoying a technical rebound, 
notching up gains of 5.41 percent to 55.20 euros in a slightly firmer 
market. spm/hd Germany-insurance-company-finance-bonds-MunichRe

Powell seeks to rebuild Turkey ties after Iraq wrangle by Francis 
Curta (-GRAPHICS-) ATTENTION - REFILING, correcting to read xxxbillionxxx 
in 13th para /// ANKARA, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin 
Powell was to arrive in Turkey later Tuesday for talks aimed at reviving 
the key relationship between Washington and Ankara, hurt by a succession 
of rows over the war against Iraq. Powell will "make sure that nobody 
gets the wrong impression we're angry with each other. He's not bringing 
money, he's not going to bang his fist on the table," an Ankara-based 
US diplomat said on Monday. The State Department's announcement of 
Powell's hastily arranged trip, which will see him also visit NATO 
headquarters in Brussels, took Ankara by surprise. Relations between 
the United States and Turkey, the only Muslim member of NATO, have 
been deteriorating since the Turkish parliament on March 1 narrowly 
rejected American plans to deploy 62,000 troops here to open a northern 
front in the Iraq war. The parliament's decision, which Deputy Defense 
Secretary Paul Wolfowitz slammed last week as a "big mistake," infuriated 
the White House. Powell, however, is not expected to raise the troops 
issue with Turkish leaders, as the US naval vessels that were due 
to offload the soldiers in Turkey have long since left the Mediterranean 
for the Gulf. But he could ask Ankara to broaden the permission it 
gave shortly after the war broke out for US warplanes to fly over 
Turkish airspace on their way to Iraq, to include a go-ahead for refueling 
over Turkey. Another crucial issue should be Turkey's insistence it 
may send further troops into the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, a 
move fiercely resisted by Washington. Ankara fears that Kurds in northern 
Iraq could declare an independent state, setting a dangerous example 
to the big Kurdish population in Turkey's own south eastern corner, 
where a separatist uprising killed over 36,000 people in the 1990s. 
But diplomats said that other issues, such as the future status of 
the divided island of Cyprus, Turkey's drive to join the European 
Union and the "war on terror" will also be on the agenda of Powell's 
visit. "The visit will focus more on bilateral issues than on Iraqi 
related contingencies," explained a Turkish diplomat. "It's a reaffirmation 
of our strategic relations... (to) make sure recent developments do 
not lead to a weakening of our strategic relationship," the diplomat 
added. The two countries should also discuss aid for Turkey to help 
it overcome the economic difficulties of the war, after Ankara lost 
out on a promised six billion dollar (5.5 billion euro) aid package 
from Washington when parliament rebuffed US overtures regarding the 
troops. The White House has asked Congress to make a decision by mid-April 
on economic aid for countries which share a border with Iraq. Turkish 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to announce he has 
written to all the members of the US Congress, explaining the situation 
in Turkey, where over 90 percent of the population is opposed to the 
war. fc/sjw/tm Iraq-war-US-Turkey

The US army's elite 101st Airborne division stepped up its campaign 
around the central Iraqi city of Najaf on Tuesday after killing several 
opposition fighters and taking another 20 prisoner, military officials 
said. The "Screaming Eagles" began the third day of their campaign 
to secure the areas south and north of the Shiite Muslim holy city 
by sending in another battalion of Apache attack helicopters to support 
infantry troops, division Aviation Brigade commander Colonel Greg 
Gass told AFP. Gass said the Apaches flew out early Tuesday to join 
a battalion of the smaller, less powerful Kiowa Warrior helicopters 
south of Najaf. The brigade's 3rd Battalion of Apaches resumed flights 
north of Najaf to support 101st infantry troops who were fighting 
an unidentified Iraqi mechanized division, Gass said. The 101st began 
its campaign around Najaf on March 30, with the primary aim of securing 
the area for communication and supply lines in the US military's push 
towards Baghdad. Najaf and Karbala, another Shiite pilgrimage city 
a further 80 kilometres (50 miles) closer to Baghdad, are vital to 
the US forces because important highways lead from there to the capital. 
Gass said he had no reports of the outcome of Tuesday's fighting. 
In Monday's clashes, Gass said the 3rd Battalion Apaches destroyed 
a "battalion's worth" of Iraqi soldiers and S-60 57mm anti-aircraft 
weapons, without going into specific numbers. A statement from US 
Central Command's headquarters in Qatar said that several Iraqis had 
been killed on Monday. "The 101st Air Assault Division conducted aggressive 
patrols northwest and south of Najaf, which resulted in the capture 
or defeat of one 120mm mortar, four weapons caches, several enemy 
KIAs (killed in action) and approximately 20 enemy prisoners of war," 
said the statement. Gass described the combat as the heaviest his 
forces had been involved in since the start of the war on March 20. 
"They fought pretty hard from first light (into the afternoon)," Gass 
said, adding eight Apaches sustained various levels of damage. "Eight 
aircraft were hit anywhere from just a hole in the rotor to significant 
tail damage," Gass said. Gass and other 101st officers said that much 
of the small arms fire that had struck the helicopters orginated from 
behind houses and other buildings. Centcom also said that further 
north near Karbala members of the 3rd Infantry Division (3ID) attacked 
enemy positions in quarries, killing several more Iraqis and taking 
around 30 prisoners. "At one point the brigade came under ineffective 
and uncoordinated enemy artillery fire which was suppressed with radar-directed 
multiple launch rocket system counterfire," it said. Further attacks 
by the 3rd Infantry Division "resulted in the destruction of two 57mm 
air defence artillery systems, two armoured personnel carriers, one 
artillery piece, nine technical vehicles, several enemy KIAs and approximately 
30 enemy prisoners of war." kma-co/kir Iraq-war-Najaf-Airborne

Some 400 police launched a series of raids Tuesday in the northern 
German city of Hamburg aimed at dismantling a people-smuggling racket, 
the interior ministry said. In a communique in Berlin, it said the 
Algerian-led network is believed to have set up in Hamburg in October 
last year. It said the group also had links in Belgium, France, Italy, 
Portugal and Spain as well as Algeria and Germany. km/yad Germany-immigration

French household confidence fell further in March for the third month 
in a row and to the lowest point for six years, official data showed 
on Tuesday against a background of concern about weakness in the economy. 
An indicator by the statistics service INSEE showed that household 
confidence had fallen to minus 32 from minus 26 in February. INSEE 
said that pessimism about the outlook for unemployment was at a "historic 
high point" but that households were slightly more confident than 
previously about their ability to save. The data was collected from 
March 1 to March 19 just before the outbreak of the war in Iraq. The 
government has shown increasing concern in the last week that prospects 
for growth this year, already reduced sharply at the beginning of 
March, are fading and that tax cuts have stimulated savings rather 
than consumption which was the main pillar of growth last year. od/hd/yad

The Turkish Association for Protecting Consumers has called a nationwide 
boycott of US and British goods in protest at the US-led invasion 
of Iraq, a spokesman for the organization said Tuesday. "We know how 
many billions of dollars the United States and Britain spend on arms. 
The less Turkish money goes to the these two countries, the less Iraqi 
children will die," Ali Cetin, head of the association's Ankara office, 
told AFP. Cetin said that the boycott, called on Monday, covered all 
goods, ranging from fast food to oil products. "We will continue the 
boycott until the end of the war," he said, adding that they had received 
information several members of the public -- which remains staunchly 
opposed to the war -- were heeding their call. To announce the boycott, 
the group has distributed several large posters, which read: "Do Not 
Be a Spectator to War, Do Not Buy US Goods!". The boycott comes just 
ahead of US Secretary of State Colin Powell's hastily-arranged trip 
to Ankara on Wednesday in a bid to mend fences after a series of rows 
on the war against Iraq. Bilateral ties have been strained since March 
1 when the Turkish parliament voted against a US request to deploy 
62,000 troops here to invade Iraq from the north. ba-han/hd Iraq-war-US-Britain-Turkey-trade-dispute

International news agency Agence France-Presse and US-based photography 
agency Getty Images have signed a strategic partnership agreement, 
the companies announced Tuesday. Under the agreement, Getty Images 
will have exclusive rights to market AFP images in North America and 
Britain. Paris-based AFP will market Getty Images photographs from 
North America to daily newspaper subscribers throughout the rest of 
the world, the companies said in a joint statement. The deal is expected 
to be implemented during the second quarter of this year, the statement 
said. "We believe that this agreement is to the benefit of all -- 
allowing Getty Images to expand our reach, AFP to optimize its resources, 
and customers to receive a truly rich and comprehensive news photography 
product," Getty Images chief executive Jonathan Klein said in the 
statement. Getty Images works with more than 250 staff and freelance 
photographers around the world who produce between 700 and 1,000 photos 
each day. AFP is an international news agency offering services in 
eight languages. Its international news photo service, launched in 
1985, has more than 300 staff photographers and hundreds of freelancers 
and produces some 1,000 news photographs per day. "The agreement is 
of major importance for AFP," AFP's chief executive Bertrand Eveno 
said in the statement. "Getty's superb coverage of North America, 
including sports and celebrities, is the perfect complement and will 
strengthen AFP's position as a major actor in photo news, servicing 
top newspapers worldwide," he said. bur-yad/gl France-US-media-AFP-Getty

The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTA) on Tuesday suspended its tourism 
advertisements overseas due to the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory 
disease. HKTA spokesman Simon Clennell said the decision was taken 
because "the climate is not right to promote Hong Kong abroad". "It 
is not cost effective to do active overseas promotion at the moment," 
Clennell told AFP. "Atypical pneumonia has changed everything." "When 
the time is right, which will not be too far ahead, we will resume 
the promotion," he said. Hong Kong is at the centre of the global 
outbreak Severe Acute Respiratory Sydndrome (SARS), which has infected 
some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed at least 62. The disease 
has so far claimed 15 lives in the former British colony. Hong Kong 
authorities have taken the extraordinary step of isolating an entire 
housing block for 10 days in an attempt to control the epidemic after 
about 200 residents were found to be infected. Clennell said Hong 
Kong's tourism industry was also hit by the US-led war in Iraq. Travel 
agencies have reported that new bookings have slumped up to 90 percent, 
with hotel occupancy rates also dropping some 30 percent. Hong Kong-based 
carriers Cathay Pacific and Dragonair have also cancelled some regional 
flights due to a drop in bookings. The territory had been looked upon 
with envy at the start of 2003 after it announced tourist numbers 
soared 20.7 percent to 16.6 million for 2002 on the back of a surge 
in mainland Chinese visitors. The local tourism industry also suffered 
another severe blow with the cancellation of concerts in Hong Kong 
by guitarist Carlos Santana and pop star Moby just days after The 
Rolling Stones axed shows in Hong Kong over the weekend. pl/dv Health-pneumonia-HongKong-tourism

Britain might wait until 2006 before holding a referendum on whether 
to join the euro zone, European Commission vice president Neil Kinnock 
was quoted as predicting on Tuesday. Kinnock, a former leader of Britain's 
governing Labour Party who maintains close ties with Prime Minister 
Tony Blair and other top figures, told the Financial Times that a 
referendum was likely in the current parliament. However it might 
not happen until shortly before the latest possible date for a general 
election, June 2006. The British government's five self-imposed economic 
tests seen as necessary to join the euro, due to be completed by this 
June, were likely to be met, Kinnock told the newspaper. However it 
was likely that more time would be taken to assess the overall economic 
and fiscal situation. "I think the answer to the tests will be: 'Yes, 
but when certain things have been accomplished'," he said. "I think 
the assessment will be positive. But what we won't have in June is: 
'Yes, and here's the date for our referendum'." Kinnock, 61, dismissed 
the idea that Blair might take advantage of any post-Iraq war euphoria 
to push through a referendum, saying this notion showed a "complete 
misunderstanding of the psyche and politics of Tony Blair." The most 
likely date was late 2005 or early 2006, he told the paper. "It would 
give you just a bit of extra time to focus public opinion on the facts," 
he said. Blair's government is pushing for Britain to join the European 
single currency, but is moving very cautiously against a thus far 
strongly negative public, which is showing great resistance to scrapping 
the British pound. The opposition Conservative Party strongly opposes 
euro membership and is keen to exploit any electoral advantage that 
might occur through a swift timetable towards euro accession. Kinnock 
added that in his opinion Blair had perhaps not done enough to begin 
preparing public opinion in what has generally been quite a shrill 
debate in Britain. "Not enough opportunities have been taken to provide 
dispassionate and objective information," he said. pw/hd Britain-forex-EU-eurozone-referendum-Kinnock

A Japanese and a European company have been shortlisted for a six 
billion ringgit (1.6 billion dollar) contract to build a coal power 
plant in Malaysia, an industry source said Tuesday. "We have shortlisted 
two companies. We are negotiating with the two parties and seeking 
some clarifications," the source told AFP on condition of anonymity. 
The official declined to name the two companies, saying a final announcement 
of the winner would be made "quite soon." Four companies had been 
in the running for the project -- Japan's Mitsubishi and Sumitomo, 
Germany's Siemens and France's Alstom. Malaysia's SKS Power, which 
plans to develop a 2,100 megawatt coal-fired power plant in the southern 
Johor state to supply electricity to state utility Tenaga Nasional, 
had earlier said it would announce the winner by the end of March. 
The Tanjung Bin power station will comprise three plants of 700 megawatts 
each. The first plant is expected to be operational in August 2006 
and the other two plants should be completed in the following year. 
At present there are only two coal-fired power plants in Malaysia 
while there are over a dozen gas-fired plants. Three-quarters of Malaysia's 
electricity is generated from gas while coal provides only 12 percent.

Sol Campbell says England can afford no more slip-ups if they are 
to book an automatic place in the 2004 European Championships. The 
fit-again Arsenal defender believes Sven-Goran Eriksson's side must 
reproduce their World Cup form if they are to dispose of closest rivals 
Turkey in Sunderland on Wednesday. The Turks hold a two-point advantage 
in Group Seven courtesy of England's failure to defeat Macedonia last 
October. "We are really in a situation now where we have to keep on 
winning. In reality we have to win all our games from this point to 
qualify as of right. It's as simple as that," Campbell said. "We don't 
want to go into a play-off if at all possible." "We know that Turkey 
will represent a big test and we will have to produce the sort of 
stuff we did against Argentina in the World Cup, but playing such 
a great side will bring the best out of the players." Eriksson was 
expected to take a tactical gamble on Wednesday by reverting to the 
midfield diamnond formation last used in Slovakia in October. But 
Turkey coach Senol Gunes warned that if it failed he might soon be 
facing the sack. "A decision could be made about him," Gunes said 
when asked what he thought would happen if England failed to qualify 
for the Portugal finals. Eriksson's plan is to give Manchester United 
star Paul Scholes more freedom. And it has got the backing of Liverpool 
star striker Michael Owen. "It obviously helps to score goals if Paul 
Scholes is further up the field," he said. "The best way to create 
space in between their back line and midfield is to stretch them with 
someone who can get in behind them, and in situations like that Scholes 
comes into his own." bur/rw03 Fbl-Euro2004-ENG-Campbell

Shares in French engineering, energy and ship-building group Alstom 
surged by 15.6 percent in early trading here on Tuesday on rumours 
that a Dutch businessman might make a takeover bid. The shares in 
the company, which recently announced a change of strategy to strengthen 
its finances, rose 15.6 percernt from the closing price on Monday 
to 1.62 euros (1.76 dollars). Brokers CDC Ixis said in a note to its 
customers: "A Dutch financier is reported to have made an offer valuing 
the share at 2.0 euros (2.17 dollars) which the Alstom board has rejected. 
He is believed to be about to offer 2.5 euros (2.72 dollars) per share."

The chief secretary to Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has retired 
from government, state media said Tuesday. Charles Utete, 65, joined 
the then prime minister's office in 1981 which later transformed into 
the president's office in 1987, as secretary. He has held the same 
post throughout his career. "This place is challenging and one does 
not want to go on until one does not have energy or strength," he 
said. "I need to rest a bit. I want to take time for a break and reflect 
on things," Utete was quoted as saying by the Herald. His retirement 
came as the southern African country faces serious political and economic 
crises. Mugabe is under increasing pressure to resolve the country's 
woes, which include more than three-quarters of the population living 
in abject poverty, triple-digit inflation, and a famine that has affected 
more than two thirds of the country's 11.6 million people. sn/stb/kdz

Livestock in southern China may be the source of the mysterious virus 
that has killed more than 60 people and caused a global health scare, 
sources close to the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Tuesday. 
"WHO is working on a theory that the virus has its source in farm 
animals in southern China," a source close to the Geneva-based body 
told AFP. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which erupted 
in southern China's Guangdong province in November, has spread to 
Hong Kong and been taken worldwide in an unprecedented fashion by 
airline passengers. "In some areas in Guangdong province in southern 
China, people just live neck to jaw with animals -- pigs, chickens, 
ducks are everywhere," the source said. Scientists have already ruled 
out a link between SARS and bird flu, also a viral disease highly 
contagious to chickens, ducks, turkeys and other birds. A bird flu 
viral strain however leapt species and claimed six people in 1997 
and left a boy dead two months ago in Hong Kong. Asked to confirm 
the links between SARS and farm animals in southern China, Peter Cordingley, 
the spokesman for the Manila-based Western Pacific WHO regional office, 
said: "At this stage, we are not saying this is the cause but is certainly 
something we are looking into in the general scheme of things." Cordingley 
said the WHO was still awaiting authorisation from the Chinese authorities 
to pay a visit to Guangdong. Jean-Marc Olive, the WHO representative 
to the Philippines, said in a separate interview on government television 
that experts were still "laboratory researching" for leads that could 
lead to the identification of the virus. "Now there is a possible 
lead that it is a virus infecting animals that jumped to various species 
as it has happened in the past and its another way to try to investigate 
these cases and discover the virus," Olive told NBN television. China 
has come under fire from various quarters for providing little information 
about the epidemic in the world's most populous nation where 34 people 
have died so far, according to Chinese authorities. The mysterious 
illness has now infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed 
at least 62 people. Hitoshi Oshitani, a Manila-based WHO expert on 
communicable disease, said viruses of many emerging diseases were 
known to have come from animals by "crossing species barriers." He 
cited as examples the deadly incurable haemorrhagic fever Ebola, whose 
virus is suspected to have come from monkeys and another killer virus, 
the Nipah virus, which may have originated from bats. The Nipah virus 
is named after the location where it was first detected in Malaysia 
in 1999, when pigs were reported to be the apparent source of infection 
among most human cases. The Nipah virus is a member of the virus family 
called paramyxoviridae. The family includes the paramyxovirus, which 
the WHO has not ruled out as a possible cause for SARS, perhaps working 
in conjunction with another virus family called coronavirus. The paramyxovirus 
causes common illnesses like mumps and measles while the coronavirus 
caused the common cold. Oshitani told AFP that the viruses linked 
to SARS are known to be different from those currently infecting humans. 
He said that some laboratories, including France's Pasteur Institute 
in Paris, found the coronavirus while others discovered the paramyxovirus 
in samples of SARS patients. "But we still don't know what is the 
relationship between the two viruses in terms of being the causative 
agent of SARS," he said. On Monday, Oshitani said scientists working 
in 11 laboratories around the world were just days away from identifying 
the SARS virus. "We still need some more time to find what is the 
real cause of the SARS outbreak and how these two viruses evolve in 
the disease history." He said SARS was the "most significant outbreak 
of a disease through air travel in history" while the international 
collaboration to determine its cause is "the biggest for an emerging 
disease." pp/cgm/rcw Health-pneumonia-Asia-virus

Thousands of Bangladeshis are ready to join forces with the Iraqis 
to fight the US-led invasion, saying they want to join a jihad, or 
holy war, veterans said Tuesday. "We have at least 5,000 members and 
they are mostly eager to go to Iraq and fight the Anglo-American forces 
who are waging an unjust war," Ziaul Kabir Dulu, chairman of the PRMS 
-- Palestine Repatriated Muktijoddah Sangshad (Freedom Fighters Council), 
told AFP. Members of PRMS have fought alongside Palestinians against 
Israel. "We seek Allah's blessings and we need fighters to save the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq with the spirit of jihad," 
Dulu said. He said he did not know if he would go to the Gulf, as 
he was in his 50s, but as well as members of his council there were 
many young Bangladeshis who have told him they want to join the war 
to save Iraq from "aggression." Mohammad Shahidullah, PRMS's general 
secretary, added they took the decision to join the war at a meeting 
in Dhaka on Monday. "Our members are spread across Bangladesh, but 
we are maintaining contact with them," he said. Asked how they planned 
to go to Iraq, Dulu said: "We joined the Palestine war by flying through 
different capitals before reaching Lebanon and we will try to do the 
same (this time)." But he said they wanted government backing as both 
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and main opposition leader Sheikh Hasina 
Wajed have called for an end to the Iraq war. However, a government 
spokesman brushed aside the demand. "Neither the government or anyone 
in the government has anything to do with these people," he said. 
Anti-war demonstrations have taken place almost daily in Bangladesh, 
the world's third largest Muslim-majority country, and Dhaka has repeatedly 
called for a peaceful end to the crisis. On Monday some 200 men took 
to the streets demanding the government help them join the war to 
save Iraq, the Bhorer Kagoj daily reported. Dulu said the issue was 
not about President Saddam Hussein's regime. "That is not the issue 
now, the issue is Iraqi people and their territorial integrity. "We 
fought indirectly against the US when we fought with the Palestinians 
and also during our independence war in 1971, as the US had backed 
Pakistan." Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, broke away to emerge 
as an independent country in 1971 after a nine-month war. Washington 
sided with the Pakistani military regime as it pursued "ping pong 
diplomacy" to restore ties with China with Islamabad's help. nq/an/sdm/rcw

Corruption cost Bangladesh 44 billion taka (745 million dollars) in 
2002, with the police heading a list of professional groups involved 
in graft, a watchdog body said here Tuesday. Transparency International, 
Bangladesh (TIB), an affiliate of the Berlin-based Transparency International 
(TI), said the amount was equivalent to 10.38 percent of the Bangladesh's 
total annual budget and 67 percent of the foreign aid received in 
the fiscal year that ended in June 2002. TIB said its findings were 
based on 2,778 graft cases reported in newspapers and the 44 billion 
taka came from 1,047 of them. It could not find losses in the rest 
of the cases. Police topped the list of professionals involved in 
graft, followed by local government and education officials, TIB said. 
The watchdog said there had been a drop in graft in 2001 compared 
to previous year, but it increased in 2002. TIB said "political will" 
was the most important factor to stop corruption in Bangladesh. Setting 
up an anti-corruption commission and ombudsman, ensuring freedom of 
the press and separation of the judiciary from the executive were 
other important measures needed, it said. The private News Network 
group, in a study entitled "Endemic Corruption in Bangladesh" released 
last week, said at least 75 percent of foreign aid received by Bangladesh 
does not reach its intended target because of corruption. Last year, 
TI said in its annual report that Bangladesh for the second time finished 
bottom of the heap in an index on perceived public sector corruption.

Israel and the United States locked horns Tuesday over the implementation 
of an US-backed peace plan, with Washington reportedly saying it will 
publish the "roadmap" despite Israeli demands that further changes 
be made. Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom stressed after a meeting 
with US President George W. Bush that the Palestinians had to fight 
"terrorism" before any implementation of the peace plan. But Bush, 
facing a tougher than expected campaign in Iraq and with mounting 
tension in the Arab world, insisted he was "serious" about pushing 
ahead with the step-bystep plan to forge a Palestinian state, Israeli 
public radio said. "I said clearly there cannot be two parallel paths: 
the war against terrorism in the day and negotiations at night," Shalom 
told the radio in Washington. "The end of terrorism constitutes the 
central question for a return to negotiations with the Palestinians," 
he said. Shalom, who was making his first visit to Washington since 
being named foreign minister last month, met Bush late Monday when 
the US leader dropped in on talks he was holding with US national 
security advisor Condoleezza Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney. 
He also met with US Secretary of State Colin Powell. The roadmap is 
a plan setting out the steps to Palestinian statehood by the year 
2005. Based on a Bush speech on the Middle East last June, it was 
drafted by US, UN, EU and Russian diplomats, but Israel has raised 
a number of objections. Foremost among its complaints is the fear 
that the plan might progress from one phase to the next without really 
tackling the problem of powerful militant groups attacking Israel. 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's advisor Dov Weisglass has said he would 
like a US mechanism to judge when the conditions have been met to 
move from phase to phase, sidelining the United Nations and European 
Union, with whom Israel has cool relations. Israel has reportedly 
proposed 100 changes to the roadmap as drafted, and convinced the 
United States to delay its publication, despite European objections, 
until after its January 28 elections. It has since been further delayed 
as the moderate new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmud Abbas, forms 
his own cabinet, in a move meant to sideline veteran Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat, seen by Israel and Washington as an obstacle to peace. 
But Israeli public radio quoted sources in Washington as saying that 
the US administration did not intend to make any changes to the roadmap 
and that it would be published "as it was". Palestinian officials 
have complained at the repeated delays in finalising the much-debated 
plan, unfavourably comparing the speed with which the United States 
and Britain went to war with Iraq and the apparent foot-dragging on 
the peace plan. Meanwhile, Washington chided both Israel and the Palestinian 
Authority (PA) over human rights abuses, noting "problems" with Israel's 
treatment of Israeli Arabs while accusing the Palestinian administration 
of having a "poor" human rights record and continuing "to commit numerous, 
serious abuses." The State Department's annual rights report said 
members of the Palestinian security forces and Arafat's Fatah faction 
of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) took part in anti-Israel 
violence and terrorist attacks. It said that while there was no proof 
of official approval of such acts, some endorsed the use of violence 
in principal in a violation of commitments to halt attacks on Israelis. 
"The PLO and PA have not complied with most of their commitments, 
notably those relating to the renunciation of violence and terrorism, 
taking responsibility for all PLO elements, and disciplining violators," 
it said. Israeli forces occupying almost the entire West Bank also 
destroyed the houses of two Palestinian militants, including the family 
home of an Islamic Jihad suicide bomber who injured some 30 people 
on Sunday in a seaside resort. Israel has demolished more than two 
hundred homes belonging to militants to deter future suicide attacks, 
but critics have slammed the policy as collective punishment. bur-jh/dab

Bangladesh has posted doctors at the country's two major airports 
to screen passengers for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), 
a health official said here Tuesday. "We have no report of any SARS 
cases, but vigilance has been increased," a government health official 
told AFP. "One doctor has been posted at each of the country's two 
major airports in Dhaka and in Chittagong along with a nurse from 
the government public health office," he said. The World Health Organisation 
(WHO) has listed Singapore, Toronto, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Taiwan and 
the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanxi and Guangdong as affected areas. 
The mysterious illness has infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries 
and killed at least 62 people. nq/gt/an/cl Health-pneumonia-Bangladesh

Nigeria's central labour movement said Tuesday it has suspended a 
strike over pay after reaching an agreement with the government on 
workers' demands. The three-day strike was to have begun on Tuesday, 
but an overnight meeting with government officials led to its suspension, 
Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) spokesman Owei Lakemfa told AFP. "We 
held a fruitful meeting with President Olusegun Obasanjo, secretary 
to the government, and the labour minister. And we agreed to suspend 
the strike pending the resolution of the dispute," he said. "The government 
has agreed to set up an implementation committee on the issue of 12.5 
percent pay rise for workers. We believe they will honour the agreement 
this time," he added. He said the NLC took the decision to embark 
on what it called a warning strike because the government has repeatedly 
reneged on previous agreements to award workers pay hikes. Two weeks 
ago, the NLC threatened to order a national strike from April 1, but 
its leaders said Sunday they were backing down on the general strike 
for now because of the April elections in the west African country.

The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTA) has decided to suspend overseas 
advertisements meant to bring tourists to the city after the outbreak 
of a deadly pneumonia that has made hundreds sick in the former British 
territory. "We have deciced to suspend most overseas advertisement 
as the climate is not right to promote Hong Kong abroad" Simon Clennell, 
HKTA spokesman, said, citing fears of Severe Acute Respiratory Sydrome 
(SARS), known commonly as atypical pneumonia. With the onset of SARS, 
which is blamed for at least 62 deaths worldwide, several countries 
issued travel warnings to steer clear of the city. "It is not cost 
effective to do active overseas promotion at the moment. Atypical 
pneumonia has changed everything," Clennell told AFP. "When time is 
right, which will not be too far ahead, we will resume the promotion." 
The disease has so far claimed 15 lives in Hong Kong and infected 
610 in this city of 6.8 million. Hong Kong has been at the centre 
of a worldwide alert over SARS since an American businessman, who 
had visited China and Vietnam, succumbed to the illness here on March 
13. The authorities have already taken the extraordinary step of isolating 
an entire housing block for 10 days after around 200 residents there 
were found to be infected. The outbreak of the killer pneumonia virus 
in Hong Kong has devastated the key tourism sector. Travel agencies 
have reported that new bookings have decreased as much as 90 percent, 
with hotel occupancy dropping some 30 percent. Hong Kong-based carriers 
Cathay Pacific and Dragonair have also cancelled some regional flights 
due to a drop in bookings. Hong Kong had been looked upon with envy 
at the start of 2003 after it announced tourist numbers soared 20.7 
percent to 16.6 million in 2002 on the back of a surge in mainland 
Chinese visitors. The local tourism industry also suffered another 
severe blow with the cancellation of concerts in Hong Kong by rocker 
Carlos Santana and pop star Moby just days after The Rolling Stones 
axed shows in Hong Kong over the weekend. Clennell also said overseas 
advertisements for Hong Kong would not be effective because of the 
war in Iraq, athough this had been anticipated earlier. pl/sdm/rcw

Offsetting criticism of Pentagon decisions in the first 12 days of 
the Iraq war, 1991 Gulf War veteran General Barry MCaffrey, writing 
in the Wall Street Journal Tuesday, said the Iraq war needs to be 
fought "hard" to win. And, warning that the United States is "overextended 
and at risk" due to US troop deployment around the world, ex-US drug 
czar McCaffrey says the time has come to acknowledge the situation's 
gravity and call up reservists and National guard divisions. "While 
early criticisms of the Pentagon have been overheated, the American 
public needs to start looking at Iraq as a war -- like all wars -- 
that we must fight hard to win," he wrote, after highlighting early 
dramatic US successes in the war. In an op-ed piece titled, "A Time 
to Fight," McCaffrey, who led the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division 
in the 1991 Gulf War, is critical of US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's 
"rolling start" concept to the attack's launch, saying it "has put 
us in a temporarily risky position." Due to the fact that US forces 
should really be fighting with three armored divisions and an armored 
cavalry regiment to give rear area security, "a war of maneuver" will 
now have to be faced in the coming days. McCaffrey notes the United 
States would be seeking to destroy five Iraqi armor divisions with 
just one US armored unit -- the Third Mechanized Infantry supported 
by "modest armor forces of the First Marine Division and the Apache 
attack helicopters of the 101st Airborne." But, he predicts: "We will 
succeed in this battle because of the bravery and skill of our soldiers 
and Marines combined with the ferocious lethality of the air power 
we will bring to bear on the enemy force." And he said that the 100,000 
troops en route to battle "will give the operational commanders the 
ability to control the pace and tempo of the fight if we sense trouble." 
The ensuing destruction of Iraq's 5,500 vehicle strong mobile force 
will shift the battle's "center of gravity" to the urban area of Baghdad. 
The toughest problem as US-led forces face the "determined opposition" 
of the Republican Guard, will be "the eradication of the thousands 
of so-called Fedayeen and the al Kut Army." "The war will not be over 
until the regime is dead or behind barbed wire. To achieve our purpose 
we must destroy the SRG and thousands of terrorist fighters." "If 
we shrink from using direct and overwhelming violence on the SRG and 
the Fedayeen, we will risk thousands of casualties in our Army and 
Marine assault forces and leave in place an unintimidated, even emboldened, 
terrorist threat that will make our subsequent occupation of the city 
an unending horror." With US forces likely to be tied up in Iraq "for 
the next 12 months at least" and others deployed elsewhere, "It is 
time to call up at least three US Army National Guard Divisions for 
36 months service along with significant Marine, Navy, Coast Guard 
and Air Force reserve elements," he wrote. "Calling up these reserve 
forces will be political and economic recognition of the gravity of 
the situation we face. We must win this second crucial battle of the 
war on terrorism that was forced on us by the tragedy of September 
11," McCaffrey. jlp/fgf Iraq-war-US-reax-McCaffrey

Five Indian border guards manning the defacto border with Pakistan 
in Kashmir died in an avalanche, Indian officials said this week. 
They said the accident happened on March 29, but reports only reached 
the summer capital of Srinagar on Tuesday. "The five were killed when 
they were patrolling in the Nowgam sector of Kupwara," a spokesman 
for India's Border Security Force (BSF) told AFP. Kupwara borders 
Pakistan-administered Kashmir and falls on the Line of control (LoC) 
-- the 742-kilometre (460-mile) defacto border that divides Kashmir 
between rivals India and Pakistan. "They had just walked out of their 
post when an avalanche sent them 1,000 feet (300 metres) down a hill," 
the spokesman said. He said Indian army and BSF reinforcements launched 
a rescue operation in the area under heavy snowfall. "They were only 
able to recover their bodies," he said. Last month more than 20 Indian 
army personnel died in a similar avalanche in the Ladakh region of 
Kashmir. str/an/sdm India-Kashmir-avalanche

War in Iraq has proved a tough challenge for the White House's usually 
tightly scripted press operation, which is struggling to maintain 
its much-vaunted image of a president above the daily fray. The latest 
misstep was over presidential TV-viewing habits, which it turns out 
are not exactly what spokesman Ari Fleischer made them out to be. 
The White House communications team had carefully cultivated a profile 
of President George W. Bush as an executive who leaves the daily war 
planning to his generals, while avoiding the saturation television 
coverage of the war. But friends say Bush is glued to his television, 
discussing breaking developments with his aides. Roland Betts, a New 
York real estate developer and long-time Bush friend, told The New 
York Times how the president spent the first weekend of the war in 
front of the television at his Camp David retreat. During the first 
major bombings of Baghdad, Fleischer had depicted a president with 
little interests in the TV coverage. "I don't think he needs to watch 
TV to know what was about to unfold," Fleischer said. Betts had a 
different take. "He is just totally immersed," Betts said of the president, 
adding that Bush immediately discussed each new development with national 
security adviser Condoleezza Rice. Bush started laughing when a television 
correspondent accurately reported the White House's official message, 
that president was not watching TV while at Camp David. That story 
forced Fleischer into a convoluted attempt at explaining away the 
discrepancy on Monday morning, when the spokesman said he called Betts 
"because I wanted to know if everything that he said was quoted accurately. 
He said it was." The White House has refused to comment on military 
operations, referring all questions to the Defense Department and 
to military spokesmen in the Gulf. But president regularly emerges 
to denounce the litany of atrocities committed against the Iraqi people 
by members of Iraq's ruling party or by Saddam Hussein's secret police. 
During these statements, Bush always tosses out some fresh detail 
on the torture inflicted on those who want to help the US-British 
troops. The aim is to convince the US public that their troops are 
fighting a war of liberation, despite the daily pictures of bombings 
and graphic stories of the horrors of combat. The White House message 
has had trouble being heard above stories in the general press questioning 
the war plan, given tough Iraqi resistance and the population's subdued 
welcome to the troops. The White House also must overcome the expectation, 
fostered by its own top officials before the war, that the conflict 
would be short. Sources close to the president spoke of his "frustration" 
at critical news stories, and his spokesman insisted that Bush was 
always prepared for a difficult war. Nonetheless, Bush had to make 
a last-minute deletion in one of his statements, which said military 
operations were running ahead of the expected schedule. But he didn't 
tell his spokesman of the deletion soon enough. The statement had 
already been given to the press corps, with the deleted line still 
intact, before he could take it back. jld/gs/ch Iraq-war-US-Bush-media

Charges that the Pentagon's civilian leaders fielded too small a ground 
force in Iraq are the latest chapter in an acrimonious struggle within 
the US armed services over how wars should be fought in an age of 
precision air power, according to analysts. The army, the source of 
the latest complaints, has long been pitted against the air force 
in a competition for influence over the future direction of US military 
almost since the invention of the airplane. But this is the first 
war in which a US military campaign has been designed to take maximum 
advantage not only of US dominance in the air, but of information 
technologies and advances in airborne surveillance and reconnaissance 
on the ground as well as the air. As such, it is putting to the test 
theories that a smaller ground force, operating in close coordination 
with air power and with greater visibility of the battlefield, can 
project the power of a much larger conventional force. "There are 
huge stakes here in terms of which service commands the larger budget 
share, which service is the most prestigious, which service's four 
stars get the most important commands," Andrew Bacevich, a retired 
army officer and Boston University professor, said Monday, But the 
intensity of the debate also is due to deeply held convictions about 
the nature of warfare with the army taking a more skeptical view of 
the promise of high technology than other services, he said. On the 
one hand are those, he said, "who think that the nature of war is 
immutable and that war is a highly risky proposition, almost uncontrollable, 
in that when victories are won they are won through the application 
of superior power." On the other side are those who believe that "the 
nature of war can be shaped, that today there is a particular opportunity 
to shape it with information technology and precision weaponry and 
that this transformed war, this revolutionary war has the potential 
to make force far more politically useful and even humane," he said. 
US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has intensified the struggle 
by pushing the army, in particular, to abandon its tank heavy Cold 
War force structure and replace it with lighter, faster deploying 
forces. Last year, he infuriated its leaders by cancelling a program 
to develop and field its 11-billion dollar Crusader artillery system 
on grounds that it was too heavy to deploy quickly. In Afghanistan, 
he opted to use special operations forces and air power to rout the 
Taliban, bringing in conventional ground forces only after most of 
the country had fallen to Afghan rebel forces. Even before Rumsfeld, 
though, the army was struggling to maintain its relevance in a world 
of unexpected wars in far-flung places. President Bill Clinton ruled 
out the use of ground forces in Kosovo, relying exclusively on air 
power to bring down the regime of Slobodan Milosevic in the former 
Yugoslavia. The army did not help its case when it took a month to 
deploy a task force of AH-64 Apache helicoptes to Albania. The low-flying 
attack helicopters were never used because of fears that they were 
too vulnerable to Serb ground fire. But with a major ground war underway 
now, the army's supporters are pointing to Iraq as vindication of 
the service's traditional approach to warfare and its pleas for more 
divisions to handle contingencies from the Middle East to Korea. "Lot 
of people said tanks are outdated, we don't need any more," said retired 
army Lieutenant General William Odom. "The idea of lightening (those) 
heavy forces, getting rid of those is, to put it politely, unwise." 
When fast moving tank columns outran their supply lines, anonymous 
army officials accused Rumsfeld of not deploying enough forces to 
the region, saying he was trying to fight the war "on the cheap." 
"The retired army officers who are complaining are the same people 
who all along have been complaining that the active force is too small 
and you need more boots on the ground," said James Carafano, an expert 
at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington 
research group. "The campaign has not been going on long enough to 
make the kind of criticisms they have been making," he said. Bacevich 
said the results so far have been mixed with dramatic advances on 
the ground offset by stiffer-than-expected resistance and unfulfilled 
hopes for a quick collapse of the regime. "The commanders on the ground 
don't care about the theological arguments," he said. "The commanders 
on the ground are trying to figure out how to accomplish their mission 
with minimum damage to their own force, and the circumstances are 
ones that call for a more deliberate campaign." jm/ga Iraq-war-US-military

Five thousand Thai prisoners convicted of drug offences are to build 
their own accommodation at rehabilitation boot camps run by the army, 
a military spokesman said Tuesday. "It forms part of their rehabilitation 
programme and aims to make them unite and learn how to work and live 
together," army spokesman Somkhuan Saengpattaranetr told AFP. "We 
also get good results for our budget," he added. Boot camps are already 
run by the army for teenage drug addicts, while army vocational camp 
programmes are also in place for prisoners who are either drug-addicts 
or convicted on drugs charges. Such camps are partly aimed at reducing 
chronic overcrowding in Thailand's jails, which is largely a result 
of the huge methamphetamines addiction problem the kingdom faces. 
The idea of getting inmates to build their own bunk-houses arose after 
Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra told the army that expensive accommodation 
should not be built in the new camps due to a lack of funds, Somkhuan 
said. The army was currently surveying suitable sites for the rehabilitation 
camps, he added. Thailand is in the midst of a three-month drugs blitz 
targeting methamphetamines, of which the country is the world's largest 
per capita consumer, according to the International Narcotics Control 
Bureau. Last September, then-Justice Minister Chaturon Chaisaeng said 
the jail system was on the brink, with just over a quarter of a million 
inmates behind bars despite capacity for only 150,000 people. More 
than 102,000 of the inmates were jailed on drug-related crimes. tp/sb/rcw

Muslim separatist guerrillas have launched fresh attacks in the southern 
Philippines, killing one person, wounding four others and burning 
a chapel, officials said Tuesday. More than two dozen MILF guerrillas 
raided the town of Sapad, located 780 kilometers (484 miles) south 
of Manila, late Monday, killing one resident and clashing with government 
militiamen. The rebels looted and burned some houses, as well as torched 
a village chapel, the military report said. Another MILF band fired 
rocket-propelled grenades at dawn Tuesday at the quarters of a military 
engineering battalion in Matanog town, located 850 kilometers (527 
miles) south of Manila, Major General Generoso Senga said. The attack 
wounded a captain, two soldiers and the wife of a soldier, Senga said. 
Eid Kabalu, spokesman of the 12,500-strong MILF, confirmed that Muslim 
guerrillas attacked Sapad and Matanog but denied that they burned 
the chapel. He also said the MILF forces had been targeting the government 
militiamen in Sapad and that the villager had been killed in the crossfire. 
The new MILF attacks came despite an announcement on Sunday that the 
government and the rebels had agreed to resume formal peace negotiations 
toward a political settlement to the 25-year conflict. Kabalu downplayed 
the new agreement, saying, "That is nothing but cosmetics. They should 
halt offensives against the MILF first," before peace talks can proceed. 
He demanded that the military withdraw from areas recently captured 
from the MILF if the talks were to resume. strs/mm/jvg/sdm Philippines-Muslim

by soldiers from the US Army's Third Infantry Division at Najaf, 150 
kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad, on Monday afternoon, Navy 
Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said. He said the victims, all 
women and children, were in a vehicle that failed to stop despite 
repeated warning shots fired by US troops. Two other people in the 
vehicle were wounded, while four others escaped unharmed. The Washington 
Post reported Tuesday that at least 10 civilians had died in the attack, 
including five children. Citing officers on the scene, it said the 
civilians were killed by the 25mm cannon fire, with one man so badly 
injured he was not expected to live. US forces in Iraq have been a 
heightened state of alert and are approaching Iraqi civilians with 
much greater circumspection following a suicide car bombing near Najaf 
on Saturday that killed four soldiers. Coalition nerves were further 
frayed on reports at the weekend that as many as 4,000 militants had 
poured into Iraq and were prepared to commit similar acts of suicide 
to defend Iraq against the US-British invasion. Well before Saturday's 
car bomb, US officers had been making no secret of their outrage at 
the guerrilla, or "terrorist," tactics they said had been practiced 
by Iraqi forces -- firing from civilian vehicles, faking surrenders 
only to open fire, fighting behind human shields. A written statement 
issued by US Central Command here said initial reports of the checkpoint 
shooting "indicate the soldiers responded in accordance with the rules 
of engagement to protect themselves." "In light of recent terrorist 
attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint 
to avoid the unnecessary loss of life." The statement contained no 
expression of regret at the loss of innocent life. On Tuesday, James 
Wilkinson, spokesman for the US Central Command, described the shooting 
as an "unfortunate tragedy" and acknowledged that young US soldiers 
could well be "a little jumpy" in the aftermath of the suicide car 
bombing. "While it is a tragedy and we certainly grieve for the loss 
of the innocent," he told a BBC interviewer, "it does point out the 
tactics that this regime is going to use. "In instances like this 
the fault lies with the regime." Owens said the deaths occurred as 
US troops opened fire on the passenger compartment as a last resort 
after a vehicle ignored hand signals and two warning shots and continued 
moving toward them. "When soldiers opened the vehicle, they found 
13 women and children inside. Seven of the occupants were dead, two 
were wounded and four were unharmed." As civilian casualties mount 
in Baghdad, where US and British forces are carrying out day and night 
air strikes, the checkpoint shooting was a further blow to a US public 
relations campaign that seeks to portray coalition troops as liberators 
and providers rather than invaders and occupiers. "On the hearts and 
minds front, the war is still not going particularly well for the 
coalition," said Alan Dupont of the Strategic and Defense Studies 
Center at the Australian National University. Australia has committed 
2,000 troops to the US-led invasion of Iraq aimed at ousting President 
Saddam Hussein. "While militarily they appear to be regaining the 
initiative, they've still got a lot of ground to make up on the public 
relations psychological warfare front." nh/dab Iraq-war-US-checkpoint

ISLAMABAD, April 1 (AFP) - US sanctions on Pakistan's top nuclear 
research facility over alleged technology-sharing with North Korea 
are fuelling a popular theory that Washington plans to deal with Pakistan's 
weapons of mass destruction once it has finished with Iraq. "It's 
possible these are signals that Pakistan has to fall in line or it 
could be the target in the future," A.H. Nayyar, an analyst from the 
Sustainable Development Policy Institute, told AFP. The US announced 
Monday it had slapped sanctions on A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories 
(KRL), a uranium enrichment plant near Islamabad, and North Korea, 
following months of claims by intelligence officials that Pakistan 
had supplied the Stalinist state with uranium enrichment technology 
for its controversial nuclear program, in exchange for missiles. US 
officials did not publicy link Islamabad and Pyongyang, but one Washington 
official said on condition of anonymity the sanctions were because 
of their alleged bilateral weapons trade, adding: "You connect the 
dots." "There has already been much talk of Pakistan becoming a target 
after Iraq," The News daily wrote Monday in response to the KRL ban. 
"That might be leaping to premature conclusions but Pakistan needs 
to be wary of the direction of its relationship with the USA." The 
"Pakistan next" theory has been bandied around for months in newspaper 
editorials, and politicians have bought into it as anti-US hostility 
swells among Pakistanis enraged at perceived US aggression and perceptions 
of ingratitude from Washington for Pakistan's pivotal war on terrorism 
role. Even President Pervez Musharraf gave it currency when he told 
businessmen on January 18 "there were chances" that Pakistan would 
become a target of Western forces after Iraq. "We will have to work 
on our own to stave off the impending danger," Musharraf said. "Cynics 
would say the axis of evil includes Pakistan also," Institute of Regional 
Studies researcher Khalid Mahmud told AFP, referring to US President 
George W. Bush's description of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. "There 
are many in Pakistan who say that after Iraq, the US will turn its 
attention to other countries and on the hit list are Iran, Syria, 
North Korea and maybe Pakistan also. "So (the KRL sanctions) may be 
an indicator of things to come." Mahmud said the main factors feeding 
the "Pakistan next" theory were the combination of Pakistan's possession 
of weapons of mass destruction and the rise of Islamic fundamentalists. 
"From the beginning this nuclear program has been branded an 'Islamic 
bomb' which poses a direct threat to Israel," Mahmud said. "The other 
irritant is the rise of religious extremist forces. These two irritants 
could be the basis of the US aggressive posture vis-a-vis Pakistan." 
Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri brushed off concerns that 
Washington had Pakistan's nuclear program in its sights. "We are not 
the next target, as we are a responsible state," he told reporters. 
Proponents of the "Pakistan next" theory point to the policy of pre-emption 
embraced by Washington in its attempt to overthrow Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein, and its goal of eliminating weapons of mass destruction. 
Musharraf is embraced by the US as a "tight" ally in its 18-month 
campaign against the Taliban and al-Qaeda and the ongoing hunt for 
fugitives from the extremist groups. But the spectre of Pakistan's 
home-grown extremists or fundamentalist Islamists getting their hands 
on its estimated 30 to 50 nuclear warheads is why the US is paying 
extra attention to Pakistan's nuclear program and not India's, analysts 
say. Fervently anti-US Islamic parties surged to power in October 
polls, winning control of one provincial parliament and almost one-fifth 
of the national parliament. Islamic militant groups continue to operate 
despite government efforts to stamp them out. They have executed 11 
deadly attacks on Christian and Western targets in the past 18 months.

Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand has been banned from driving 
for six months and fined the maximum 2,500 pounds (4,000 dollars) 
after notching up a string of driving offences. The 30-million pound 
(47 million dollar) England defender was found guilty of clocking 
92mph (150kmh) on the M1 motorway last year, the Manchester Evening 
News reported Tuesday. He had been ordered to appear in person at 
a Leeds court but a district judge accepted that the 24-year-old, 
on international duty with England, did not have to appear and imposed 
the fine and restrictions in his absence. Ferdinand, who was also 
ordered to pay 3,000 pound costs, already had nine points on his licence 
from two previous speeding offences and was automatically disqualified 
through the "totting up" procedure. Rio, who earns 70,000 pounds (100,dollars) 
a week, has just signed a lucrative three-year deal with shirt-maker 
Ben Sherman. Manchester paid Leeds United a world record 30 million 
pounds for a defender for Ferdinand last July. bur/rw/ak Fbl-ENG-PR-ManUtd-Ferdinand

A court in the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan Tuesday handed 
out stiff jail sentences to the leaders of an uprising against the 
country's autocratic government. Four men were imprisoned for between 
five and nine years after being found guilty of last year leading 
clashes with police in the town of Nardaran, which left one local 
man dead and dozens injured. Another 11 defendants also charged in 
relation to the clashes in Nardaran, about 30 kilometres (18 miles) 
from Baku, walked free from the court after being given suspended 
sentences. The case has attracted attention from western diplomats 
and human rights groups, who allege that Azerbaijan's government cracked 
down fiercely on those involved because Nardaran is an opposition 
stronghold. "This is an unjust decision and a violation of the constitution," 
Hadzhiaga Nuriyev, a village eleder from Nardaran, said outside the 
court. "We will use all legal means available to get this overturned." 
One of the convicted men, Alikram Aliyev, is the chairman of Azerbaijan's 
outlawed Islamic Party. He was given nine years in a penal colony.

BRUSSELS, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell could 
hold discussions on Iraq with European Union foreign ministers in 
Brussels on Thursday, a diplomatic source in the Belgian capital told 
AFP. Contacts were being made on Tuesday with a view to setting up 
the meeting, which has been requested by the US administration, the 
source said. Powell is set to discuss the US-led war on Iraq with 
Turkish leaders on Tuesday. He will then travel on to Brussels for 
talks with NATO and three senior European officials -- EU foreign 
policy chief Javier Solana, European External Affairs Commissioner 
Chris Patten and Greek Foreign Minister Georges Papandreou, whose 
country holds the rotating presidency of the 15-nation bloc. The US 
State Department has said Powell hopes to raise issues about the invasion 
of Iraq, now in its 13th day, and about the post-war future of the 
oil-rich country. phv/gil/yad Iraq-war-US-EU-Powell

A bomb exploded under a gas pipeline in the Indonesian city of Medan 
early Tuesday -- the second blast in the city in less than 24 hours 
-- but there were no casualties, police said. North Sumatra police 
spokesman Amrin Karim said the bomb was placed under a gas pipeline 
across a bridge over the Deli river but the explosion only dented 
the steel pipe and twisted its protective cage. The pipeline belongs 
to state energy giant Pertamina. An earlier report said the blast 
occurred 700 meters from the pipeline. A second bomb, which failed 
to explode, was found at the other end of the bridge, Karim told AFP, 
describing the blast as a "terror" act. On Monday afternoon a strong 
explosion rocked the parking lot of the Medan city administration's 
offices, shattering windows and damaging two cars. No one was hurt. 
That bomb was attached to a bicycle parked between the cars, police 
said. National police are investigating whether the blasts are linked 
to earlier explosions in Indonesia, including the Bali terror bombings 
last October 12 which killed 202 people. Sources quoted by the state 
Antara news agency said the Medan municipality had received threats 
from a caller related to entertainment activities held in the complex. 
Police said Tuesday's bombs were similar to the one that exploded 
on Monday. North Sumatra governor Rizal Nurdin said Monday the attack 
on the local government building was "an act of terror and aimed at 
creating restlessness." Provincial police chief Inspector General 
Dewa Astika said the attacks on Monday and Tuesday were related but 
police had yet to determine the motive. "We have increased security 
at vital installations and asked the public to be vigilant and report 
any suspicious things to police," Astika was quoted by the Detikcom 
online news service as saying. Indonesia has been hit by a series 
of bombings over the past few years. The Bali nightclub blasts were 
blamed on regional terror group Jemaah Islamiyah. Asked if the Medan 
attacks were related to previous bombings, national police spokesman 
Edward Aritonang told AFP: "We are still gathering information. We're 
analysing it and we haven't come to any conclusion yet." tn/sm/rcw

Indonesia's consumer price index fell 0.23 percent in March from the 
previous month due to declines in food prices and rose 7.12 percent 
from a year earlier, the Central Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. 
"Historically, March inflation is normally low. And this year food 
price falls were the key factor because of a good harvest supported 
by good weather conditions," said bureau chief Sudarti Surbakti. Food 
prices fell by 2.26 percent in March. The government target for inflation 
up to nine percent this year. bur/sm/bro Indonesia-inflation

Intense bombing of Baghdad and Saddam palace, civilian death toll 
climbs by Nayla Razzouk and Jacques Charmelot = (PICTURES) = BAGHDAD, 
April 1 (AFP) - President Saddam Hussein's biggest palace took another 
hit Tuesday, as the battering of Baghdad intensifies and civilian 
death tolls rises ever higher with US-led forces pummeling the defiant 
Iraqi regime. Around a dozen missiles crashed into the Iraqi capital 
overnight after a day of the heaviest bombardment since the war began 
on March 20. An AFP reporter saw a missile or smart bomb explode in 
the heart of the Republican Palace complex around 09:00 (0600 GMT) 
on the 13th day of the war. A huge plume of smoke rose into the air 
over the sprawling palace grounds, a potent symbol of Saddam's grip 
on power which has been a frequent target of the bombardments. At 
US central command in Qatar, a military spokesman admitted that US 
troops, fearful of a fresh suicide attack, opened fire on a civilian 
vehicle killing seven women and children. The shooting occurred at 
a checkpoint manned by soldiers from the US Army's Third Infantry 
Division at Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad, on 
Monday afternoon, Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said. The 
admission came after villagers on the edge of the capital reported 
20 more civilians dead, 11 of them children, from the blitz. Intense 
bombardments also resumed Tuesday after a night of relative calm on 
the outskirts of the city, where four divisions of Saddam's elite 
Republican Guard were dug in to defend the capital from any ground 
attack. AFP reporters said the raids are getting worse. Overnight 
the ominous whistle of the missiles was heard in the sky before a 
series of explosions shook the city, appearing to knock out electricity 
in entire neighbourhoods. Balls of smoke slowly merged into a single 
cloud overhead. Official sites of the regime were targeted. Two missiles 
were seen smashing into the Republican Palace compound along the banks 
of the Tigris River, which had already been pounded earlier in the 
day. The eerie silence in the aftermath of the raid was broken only 
by the wail of ambulance sirens, their flashing red lights criss-crossing 
the main avenue along the river. US Central Command said coalition 
forces had used "precision-guided munitions to target a regime office 
complex in eastern Baghdad" at around 11:30 pm (1930 GMT) on Monday. 
The office complex served as an office location for regime leaders 
and housed Iraq's National Olympic Committee and the Ministry of Youth. 
"The strike was executed to erode the command and control capabilities 
of regime leaders," it said, adding that battle assessment was ongoing. 
Coalition forces say thousands of attack sorties have been carried 
out since the war began with 1,000 on Sunday alone. The information 
ministry was hit earlier Monday, and domestic television was knocked 
out for several hours. Hospital sources said coalition bombing killed 
six Iraqis and wounded dozens of others in a Baghdad residential neighbourhood 
Monday. An AFP journalist was accompanied to Janabiyah village on 
the southeastern edge of Baghdad, where residents said 11 children 
were among 20 people killed when missiles hit five sleeping families 
on a farm Saturday night. The victims had already been buried according 
to Muslim tradition but the stench of death still hung over the farm. 
One building had been flattened, and the carcasses of dead animals 
were black with swarms of flies. Schoolbooks soaked in blood testified 
to the carnage. The United States and Britain say the war will not 
be finished until Saddam's 24-year grip on power is ended. However 
state television underscored Saddam was still in control of the country. 
It showed him chairing a meeting of top aides including Uday, his 
elder son, who was being shown on television for the first time since 
the war began. It said the footage had been recorded Monday. Uday 
heads the Saddam Fedayeen militia, intensely loyal fighters who have 
joined regular Iraqi forces in mounting fierce resistance to US and 
British ground troops in the south hoping to push their way to Baghdad. 
Iraq says Baghdad will be a "cemetery" for coalition forces and claims 
more than 4,000 people from across the Arab world have come to the 
capital, ready to "martyr" themselves in suicide attacks. AFP reporters 
in Lebanon and Jordan saw dozens of volunteers board buses headed 
for Iraq to volunteer for the war. A senior US commander said US forces 
were stopping people from travelling through the western desert towards 
Baghdad. An Iraqi military spokesman said at least 54 US and British 
soldiers had been killed in the previous 24 hours, most in the south 
of the country. bur/bp/dab Iraq-war-Baghdad

KUWAIT CITY, April 1 (AFP) - US forces Tuesday pressed their military 
operations south of Baghdad ahead of an expected major push on the 
Iraqi capital to put an end to the regime of President Saddam Hussein. 
The US army's elite 101st Airborne Division stepped up its campaign 
around the city of Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad, 
flying in Apache and Kiowa attack helicopters to support infantry 
troops, officers said. The 101st Airborne and the US Army's 3rd Infantry 
Division were poised for a concerted drive against Baghdad with two 
formations of US marines to their east also moving toward the capital. 
The action Tuesday followed a day of fighting Monday which Colonel 
Greg Gass, the 101st's aviation brigade commander, described as the 
heaviest his forces had been involved in since the start of the war 
on March 20. "They fought pretty hard from first light (into the afternoon)," 
Gass said, adding eight Apaches sustained hits "from just a hole in 
the rotor to significant tail damage." US officials also said the 
Army 3rd Infantry Division attacked Iraqi positions Monday in quarries 
below Karbala, another Shiite Muslim holy city 70 kilometers (45 miles) 
to the north of Najaf. They said elements of the 3rd Infantry Division 
also hit out northward at what they called pockets of Iraqi resistance 
in the area. Two air defense artillery systems, two armored personnel 
carriers, one artillery piece and nine technical vehicles were destroyed, 
they said. Several Iraqis were killed and about 30 taken prisoner. 
The tank-busting Apaches, as well as British and US warplanes, have 
been softening up the area around Karbala where the Republican Guard's 
armored Medina division was reported to be lying in wait to defend 
Baghdad. US-British forces kept up their bombardment of the capital 
Tuesday, hitting the main presidential palace complex for the second 
consecutive day. Three days after a suicide bombing killed four US 
soldiers, American troops fearful of a fresh attack opened fire on 
a civilian vehicle at a military checkpoint at Najaf, killing seven 
women and children, officials said. Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles 
Owens said at US headqarters in Qatar that the victims were in a vehicle 
that failed to stop despite warning shots fired by US troops. Four 
people in the vehicle escaped unharmed. US marines were busy securing 
supply routes and mopping up areas of southern Iraq. Officials said 
they seized Sunday a huge ammunition supply depot with rifles, rocket-propelled 
grenades, mortars and other weapons. "We continue to press the attack 
against the enemy, conducting spoiling raids," said Colonel Bennett 
Saylor, 1st Marine Division chief of staff. No further details were 
available. British forces besieging the port of Basra said they were 
waiting for more manpower before trying to take the southern metropolis. 
They kept up their siege after taking the neighboring town of Abu 
al-Khasib, 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the southeast, and rattling 
the western suburbs of Basra with artillery Monday. In London the 
defense ministry said a British soldier had been killed "during an 
explosive ordnance disposal operation" in southern Iraq. It gave no 
further details. The death brought to 26 the number of British soldiers 
killed since the beginning of the war nearly two weeks ago, 15 of 
them in accidents. Five have been killed by friendly fire and five 
have died in combat. bur/pm/kir Iraq-war-battle

Japan's defence agency on Tuesday retracted an announcement by its 
navy chief that it had confirmed North Korea had test-fired a missile 
into the Yellow Sea, saying it was still checking if there was a missile 
launch. Maritime Self Defence Force Chief of Staff Koichi Furusho 
told reporters earlier in the day that Japan had confirmed that a 
missile was test-fired by North Korea. But some three hours later, 
Shoei Yamanaka, chief of the defence agency's secretariat, "corrected 
the remark," according to an agency spokesman. "It was not right to 
say we had confirmed missile firing as a fact, but what is right is 
that we have obtained information suggesting missile firing," Yamanaka 
was quoted as saying. "We are still checking details, including whether 
a missile was actually fired or not," the spokesman said, who refused 
to disclose the source of the apparently erroneous information. The 
government's top spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda was 
cautious when asked about the alleged missile test-firing at a regular 
press conference. "There is (such) information but we have not confirmed 
it," he said. Shortly after the Japanese announcement of a missile 
firing, South Korea's defense ministry flatly rejected reports of 
North Korea's missile launch. "There was no sign that North Korea 
test-fired a missile today," a ministry spokesman told AFP in Seoul. 
"That's our ministry's official stance on the issue." The news on 
the missile firing broke after Land, Infrastructure and Transport 
minister Chikage Ogi announced the missile launch at the end of a 
parliamentary committee session. "I just received a preliminary report 
that North Korea seems to have fired a surface-to-vessel missile at 
10:15 am, that the launch site was Hwajinri in Pyongannamdo (province) 
on the opposite side (of the Korean Peninsula) from the previous launch 
site and that its range was 60 kilometres (38 miles) like the previous 
time," a ministry spokesman quoted Ogi as saying. mis/rcw NKorea-nuclear-missile-Japan-retract

An American business group on Tuesday urged the US Congress to normalise 
trade ties with Laos, stressing the importance of Southeast Asia to 
US political, economic and security interests. Establishment of normal 
trade relations (NTR) with Laos would be in the United States' national 
interest as it could stem the illegal export of narcotics, the US-ASEAN 
Business Council said. It could also lead to lowering of tariffs by 
Laos, which has the highest rates in the world averaging 45.3 percent, 
exceeding North Korea's 35 percent, and help the impoverished Southeast 
Asian nation gain entry into the World Trade Organisation, the council 
said. ASEAN is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations which groups 
Laos along with Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the 
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The council represents 
150 US firms doing business in ASEAN, a market of 500 million people. 
Council president Ernest Bower has written to Philip M. Crane, chairman 
of the subcommittee on trade, committee on ways and means at the US 
House of Representatives to voice the group's support for the normalisation 
of trade ties with Laos. The subcommittee has been soliciting comments 
before Congress moves to ratify a US-Laos bilateral trade agreement 
negotiated in 1997. Bower said in his letter that "the importance 
of the ASEAN region to American political, economic and security interests 
is increasing and there is a lot that needs to be done to increase 
our engagement of ASEAN and its member nations." Normalising trade 
ties with Laos is achievable within this year, he said in the letter, 
a copy of which was received by AFP here. "Laos now exports garments, 
gems and jewelry, agricultural products, hydro-electricity, timber, 
labor and narcotics (illegally)," Bower said. "As a matter of US national 
interest, if we would like Laos to export less in the last three categories, 
we have to help them export more in the first four. NTR is key to 
that," he said. Laos however must provide US firms and their own companies 
with the "legal framework and operational authority" for successful 
trade and investments. The Lao government must also continue efforts 
to stem the illegal flow of narcotics and address issues related to 
prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action during the Indochina 
war. mba/bh/bro ASEAN-Laos-US

India has set up a panel to assess the impact of the US-led war on 
Iraq on exports, remittances, oil prices and tourism, a report said 
Tuesday. The decision to set up the standing group on economic fallout 
was taken at a meeting of India's economic think-tank, the Planning 
Commission, the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency reported. The 
new seven-member panel consists of officials from the agriculture, 
tourism, energy and industry ministries. It will provide recommendations 
to a group of top bureaucrats to avert any adverse impact on the economy, 
PTI said. On Monday the Reserve Bank of India said rising oil prices 
could put pressure on inflation. India imports around 70 percent of 
its oil needs from overseas and high global oil prices will increase 
manufacturing costs and erode profits and competitiveness of exporters.

The world has experienced 11 of the 13 hottest years on record since 
1990, a leading international meteorologist said here Tuesday. "Since 
1976, the global average temperature has risen at a rate approximately 
three times faster than the century-scale trend," Godwin Obasi, secretary 
general of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), said at a 
conference on climate change. The year 1998 was the hottest since 
records were first made in certain parts of the world in 1860, followed 
by 2002, he said. "We are also certain that the atmospheric concentration 
of carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased from 280 ppm (parts per million) 
in 1750 to 370 ppm by the end of 2001. "Today's CO2 concentration 
has not been exceeded in the past 420,000 years and not likely during 
the past 20 million years," Obasi said. The burning of fossil fuels 
produces CO2, long seen as the main "greenhouse gas" causing global 
warming. Obasi also said the world has witnessed a growing number 
of "unprecedented extreme weather events," such as tropical cyclones, 
severe floods and droughts that have resulted in considerable loss 
of life in many countries including China, host of the ongoing conference. 
Northern China, like Brazil, South Africa and many areas in the Middle 
Eastern and Central Asia are all suffering from record-breaking droughts, 
he said. The ongoing symposium aims to improve meteorological forecasts 
and the impact of climate change on "the public and private sectors, 
particularly as it relates to environmental protection and sustainable 
development." The conference was opened by newly appointed Chinese 
Vice Premier Hui Liangyu, who is in charge of China's agricultural 
issues. boc-sai/ph/th Climate-environment

India's cricket captain Sourav Ganguly said on Tuesday he was still 
trying to recover from his team's defeat in the World Cup final against 
Australia. "Losing the final has taken the glory away from the team's 
good performance in the tournament," Ganguly said at a function here. 
"They (Australia) are the best, but it does not mean we should have 
lost to them." India lost only two matches in the entire tournament 
in South Africa -- both of them to Australia -- in the preliminary 
league and the final on March 23. The cricket-mad country went into 
mourning after the team's loss, with Ganguly coming in for severe 
flak for his decision to field first after winning the toss. Australia, 
fired by a brilliant century from captain Ricky Ponting, amassed a 
World Cup final record total of 359-2 to crush India by 125 runs. 
But Ganguly said the Indian team had impressed the entire cricketing 
world by its performance in the tournament, which included a six-wicket 
win over arch-rivals Pakistan in the first round. "The way the team 
played, the whole country is proud. I am sure we can win the World 
Cup in 2007 in the West Indies," the Indian captain said. "It's a 
young side with nine players having played the World Cup for the first 
time. With the experience, we are now better placed to win in 2007." 
The Indian team will take part in the April 11-20 tri-series in Dhaka 
against South Africa and Bangladesh. There is no international cricket 
scheduled for the team after that until the home Test series against 
New Zealand in October. The Indian team for the Dhaka tri-series will 
be selected on Wednesday amid reports that senior players like Sachin 
Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and Javagal Srinath will be rested.

The US-led war against Irag is likely to push North Korea to develop 
nuclear weapons, a Russian deputy foreign minister said Tuesday. "Unfortunately 
the Iraqi situation is driving the North Koreans to strengthen their 
defences," the Interfax news agency quoted Alexander Losyukov as saying. 
Asked if he meant that North Korea would seek to acquire nuclear weapons, 
Losyukov replied that "this is absolutely clear, and the absence of 
a negotiating process significantly increases this danger." bb/hm/yad

Turkey does not know of any new demands by key ally the United States 
to help out in the war against Iraq, Turkey's foreign minister Abdullah 
Gul said Tuesday ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Colin Powell. 
"What we know right now is that Powell is visiting an ally country. 
There is nothing planned," Gul told the Anatolia news agency when 
queried on whether Powell would fly into Ankara with new requests. 
Several Turkish newspaper speculated on Tuesday that Powell may ask 
Ankara for the use of airbases in the war against Iraq during his 
visit. Turkey is currently allowing US warplanes to use its airpsace 
for raids against Iraq. Gul said that he believed Powell's visit would 
help "clear up certain doubts" in bilateral relations. Turkish-US 
ties have deteriorated since March 1 when the Turkish parliament voted 
against a US request to deploy 62,000 troops here to open a northern 
front against Baghdad that, according to military analysts, would 
have shortened the war and minimized casulaties. han/yad Iraq-war-US-Turkey-Powell

Shares in French engineering, energy and ship-building group Alstom 
surged by 15.6 percent in early trading here on Tuesday on rumours 
that a Dutch businessman might make a takeover bid. The shares in 
the company, which recently announced a change of strategy to strengthen 
its finances, rose 15.6 percent from the closing price on Monday to 
1.62 euros (1.76 dollars), having shown a gain of 18.0 percent. Brokers 
CDC Ixis said in a note to its customers: "A Dutch financier is reported 
to have made an offer valuing the share at 2.0 euros (2.17 dollars) 
which the Alstom board has rejected. He is believed to be about to 
offer 2.5 euros (2.72 dollars) per share." The board has not commented 
on the rumours. Alstom is expected to report a loss of about 1.3 million 
euros (1.4 million dollars) for the year to March, is weighed down 
by debt of 5.0 billion euros (5.45 billion dollars) and intends to 
raise 600 million euros (654 million dollars) in new capital to strengthen 
strained cash resources. The new chief executive Patrick Kron has 
also announced that the group will raise 3.0 billion euros (3.27 billion 
dollars) through asset sales by 2005. hz/hd/yad France-engineering-energy-company-takeover-Alstom

British forces in southern Iraq are swapping their helmets for berets 
as markets and schools reopen, but the battle for the key regional 
centre of Basra still lies ahead, officers said Tuesday. Flight Lieutenant 
Peter Darling said British troops were "nibbling at the edges" of 
Iraqi defences in the city of more than one million people which is 
seen as a vital staging post for humanitarian supplies. The British 
attacked outlying areas of Basra on Monday but were awaiting reinforcements 
before any drive into the town centre, which has been defended by 
paramilitary forces fiercely loyal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
"We're basically taking out small chunks of the city. We're not going 
to be rushed into there and liberate it in what one would consider 
to be an onslaught, as it were," he said at the US-led coalition's 
command centre here. "We're going to use our own timetable and do 
it in our own way. Hopefully as the civilians realise that we're here 
for the long haul we'll get more and more information about where 
the enemy troops are." In the neighbouring town of Abu al-Khasib, 
20 kilometres (12 miles) away, reports said the last Iraqi resistance 
had been wiped out and British troops were being welcomed by some 
residents. Darling said the region around Basra was generally returning 
to normal after being "liberated" by British forces. "The good news 
is that in three towns -- Az-Zubayr, Rumaila and Safwan -- the soldiers 
are putting their berets on, which shows that there's a large degree 
of confidence returning to the area," Darling said. "Indeed the schools 
and the markets are reopening." smc/kir Iraq-war-Britain-Basra-berets

Manchester United, the world's richest soccer club, have announced 
reduced profits of 20.3 million pounds (32 million dollars) for the 
six months to the end of January. Higher media revenues and six more 
home Cup games lifted turnover in the six months to January 31 by 
13 percent to 92.6 million pounds (146 million dollars) while operating 
profits before player sales rose 32 percent to 31.1 million pounds 
(49 million dollars). However, pre-tax profits were 34 percent lower 
because the club raked in less cash in transfer market. In the previous 
period, the club generated 16.3 million pounds from selling Jaap Stam 
to Italian club Lazio and Andy Cole to English side Blackburn. "We 
have significantly improved our operating performance," said chief 
executive Peter Kenyon. "The strength of the balance sheet and our 
diversified revenue streams have increased the resilience and competitiveness 
of Manchester United. "Looking ahead, we have a clear strategy focusing 
on the development of media rights, the conversion of more fans to 
customers and the leveraging of our global brand." The club also have 
a debt-free balance sheet, which they said reflected strong operating 
cash flow and lower expenditure as a result of the completion of the 
Old Trafford stadium and academy facilities in the previous year. 
United's wage bill for the six-month period was 39.7 million pounds 
(63 million dollars) but at 43 percent of turnover this is still within 
the club's target of 50 percent. The second half of the financial 
year includes the close season and United said they expect the percentage 
to rise to 50 percent later in the year. Commercial turnover lifted 
4 percent to 22.8 million pounds with United benefiting from a new 
partnership with Nike and eight new sponsorship deals. "The strength 
of the balance sheet and our diversified revenue streams have increased 
the resilience and competitiveness of Manchester United plc," Kenyon 
said. He said the company's future strategy would concentrate on the 
development of media rights and the conversion of more fans into customers. 
"We're delighted with what we think are a strong set of financial 
results. Today our shareholders will be very happy that we have a 
business which sets ourselves apart from the rest of the industry." 
Recent share acquisitions from racehorse owners JP McManus and John 
Magnier, which made them the biggest single stakeholders in the club, 
increased speculation that the duo are planning a takeover at Old 
Trafford. But Kenyon dismissed the speculation. "There is no evidence 
of that (a takeover) and what we've seen are people joining our share 
register on the basis that we are an undervalued asset," he told BBC 
Radio. "This is not just a football club. It's consistently set itself 
apart from other clubs and this morning is no different. We can offer 
shareholders a solid return over a number of years. "Manchester United 
will always attract huge speculation but what we have to get back 
to is that it's a well run business capable of giving our shareholders 
a return." Last month, Kenyon said failure to land a trophy for the 
second successive season would be unacceptable. United are second 
to Arsenal in the English Premiership and play nine-times European 
Cup winners Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals this 
month. bur/rw/ak Fbl-ENG-Pr-ManUtd-profits

Nigeria's central labour movement said Tuesday it has suspended a 
strike over pay after reaching an agreement with the government on 
workers' demands. The three-day strike was to have begun on Tuesday, 
but an overnight meeting with government officials led to its suspension, 
Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) spokesman Owei Lakemfa told AFP. "We 
held a fruitful meeting with President Olusegun Obasanjo, secretary 
to the government, and the labour minister. And we agreed to suspend 
the strike pending the resolution of the dispute," he said. "The government 
has agreed to set up an implementation committee on the issue of the 
12.5 percent pay rise for workers. We believe they will honour the 
agreement this time," he added. He said the NLC took the decision 
to embark on what it called a warning strike because the government 
has repeatedly reneged on previous agreements to award workers pay 
hikes. Lakemfa said the central labour movement was also concerned 
about the forthcoming elections. "We do not want to heat up the system 
ahead of the general and presidential polls in April. There are lots 
of bad things going on such as political assassinations, long queues 
for petrol, that it will be unreasonable to add to the sufferings 
of the masses," he added. The spokesman said the NLC believes in dialogue 
as means of resolving trade disputes. "The NLC is always harping on 
dialogue because it is the only viable option to industrial peace 
and harmony," he said. On March 12, the NLC threatened to call a national 
strike from April 1 because of the government's failure to honour 
a pay agreement. But on Sunday, its leaders said they were backing 
down on the general strike for now because of the April elections 
in the west African country. "We have limited the strike to three 
days in order to ensure that the forthcoming elections are conducted 
peacefully," NLC's president Adams Oshiomhole told reporters. Nigeria 
is to hold local, governorship and presidential elections this month 
-- the first since the west African country returned to democracy 
in 1999 after more than 15 years of military rule. He said an indefinite 
and general strike would be launched later if the Nigerian government 
failed to implement a 12.5 percent pay rise for the workers. In May 
2000, the government pledged a 25 percent pay rise would be awarded 
to workers in January 2002, but the agreement was never implemented. 
The government cited a flagging economy as its reason for not honouring 
the agreement. A joint committee of government officials and labour 
reduced the increase to 12.5 percent in 2002, but the government still 
failed to implement the agreement. joa/kdz Nigeria-social-strike

The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ordered US carriers 
to resume payments to their Philippine telecoms counterparts after 
a row about payments for inbound rates, the local firms said Tuesday. 
The FCC had previously ordered US carriers to freeze payments to six 
Philippine carriers for allegedly pressuring the US firms to accept 
higher rates. The regulatory agency had charged that the Philippine 
telephone firms disrupted the US-Philippine networks of the AT and 
T and Worldcom in retaliation for their refusal to agree to the local 
demand for rate increases. In retaliation, FCC's Philippine counterpart, 
the National Telecommunications Commission, ordered local carriers 
to reject calls from their US counterparts that refuse to pay them 
for services rendered. But Bayan Telecommunications Inc. (Bayantel) 
and Digital Telecommunications Philippines Inc. (Digitel) on Tuesday 
said they had received an order from the FCC instructing US carriers 
to resume payments. "With the lifting of the order, we can now resume 
more normal business arrangements," said Tunde Fafunwa, a financial 
consultant for Bayantel. "With the new ruling, it clearly indicates 
that all those... payments are due and that normal settlements can 
resume now," he added, without giving an amount on how much the US 
carriers owed. He said it was not clear if the FCC ruling also applied 
to other local carriers such as Philippine Long Distance Telephone 
Co. and its unit Smart Communications, and Globe Telecom Inc. Digitel 
said it also received a copy of the ruling. Fafunwa said the dispute 
had "created uncertainty in the industry as a whole and between the 
relationship of carriers both large and small both in the US and the 
Philippines." But he said the carriers must "continue discussing the 
matter and try to settle the dispute amicably." Local carriers increased 
their termination rates, or share of the revenues from long-distance 
calls, in February, citing the need for them to be competitive. They 
claim that most international carriers have agreed on the rate increase, 
but the US firms resisted the payments leading to the dispute. jvg/cgm/dv

Beijing wants Manila to free 62 Chinese alleged poachers ahead of 
the scheduled visit next month of National People's Congress chairman 
Wu Bangguo, diplomatic sources said Tuesday. Wu is set to make a week-long 
visit to Manila from May 6 to turn over the leadership of the Asia-Pacific 
Parliamentary Union to Jose de Venecia, the speaker of the Filipino 
House of Representatives, the foreign department said. A diplomatic 
source said Beijing is seeking to have the Chinese fishermen released 
ahead of Wu's visit. The fishermen were arrested in two batches early 
last year off the northern town of Aparri and near the western island 
of Palawan. "It's not categorical, (but there are) hints that the 
visit would be more definite with a resolution of the cases of the 
Chinese fishermen," one source said. The sources said Manila has limited 
leeway because the cases of the fishermen have been filed in court. 
The judiciary is an independent branch of the Philippine government. 
"We have to see how we can facilitate their release within our laws. 
Enforcement of laws should always take precedence over bilateral relations," 
one source said. The two neighbors are rival claimants to several 
small islands in the South China Sea. In previous cases Manila has 
tried Chinese fishermen but then freed them rather than force them 
to serve their jail terms. str/cgm/mm/th Philippines-China

Veteran AC Milan defender Paolo Maldini said Tuesday he wants to win 
the Champions League as a captain before hanging up his boots. On 
Monday Maldini, a European Cup winner in 1989, 1990 and 1994, signed 
a one-year extension to his existing contract that will keep at the 
Serie A club until June 2005. "I would like to raise the cup up to 
the sky because as captain it would mean something very special to 
me," said the 34-year-old former Italy international. "It's true I've 
been a winner three times before, but to win it as the skipper would 
be particularly significant." Maldini has taken a 30 per cent pay 
cut to remain at Milan, but insisted it was a small price to pay to 
stay at the club he joined as a schoolboy. "For the love of Milan 
I will earn less," he said. "I've extended my contract and my salary 
is lower. "I'm happy to do so in these difficult times and at my age 
it's perhaps easier to be flexible. "I'm not sure I would have been 
able to accept it if I were 28." Maldini said he had no desire to 
play abroad, despite reported interest from several European clubs. 
"To play my last years at a club inferior to Milan's level would not 
have made sense," he said. "Don't forget I was born in Milan, I've 
always lived here and I'm not sure how easy it would be for me settle 
in elsewhere. "Sometimes I think it would have been nice to move to 
a different country and experience new things, but I'm coming to the 
end of my career and I don't think I could find somewhere that is 
better for me than Milan. "I have a special relationship with the 
Milan shirt. My father was Milan captain many years ago and the Maldini 
story is tied to this club." Maldini made his debut for Milan on January 
20, 1985 at the age of 16 against Udinese and has since spent 19 seasons 
at the San Siro. He has made 501 league appearances and scored 25 
goals in Serie A. Maldini has played in 120 European Cup (Champions 
League) matches, an Italian record. In his time at Milan he has won 
six Italian league titles, three European Cups, four Italian Cups, 
three European Super Cups and two Intercontinental Cups. Italy's most 
capped player, Maldini made 126 appearances for the Azzurri before 
retiring from international football after last year's World Cup in 
Japan and South Korea, his fourth appearance in the finals. Milan 
play the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final away to 
Dutch giants Ajax on April 8 before hosting the return on April 23.

European stocks rallied in early trading on Tuesday following sharp 
falls the previous day, bucking a downward trend on Wall Street overnight 
as traders set aside war worries briefly. The British FTSE 100 index 
of leading shares rose 1.1 percent to 3,652.8 points, the German DAX 
30 index increased 1.4 percent to 2,456.0 points and the French CAC 
40 index was up 1.3 percent to 2,653.4 points. The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 
index of leading euro-zone shares -- which had plunged 4.5 percent 
on Monday -- rebounded 1.5 percent to 2,129.6 points. The euro rose 
to 1.0911 dollars. The stock market turnaround came despite a slide 
in New York on Monday, which saw the Dow Jones industrials average 
of 30 top stocks drop 1.89 percent and the Nasdaq index decline just 
over two percent. Dealers there had taken fright at the prospect of 
a drawn-out, bloody war in Iraq, as well as a multi-billion dollar 
legal threat to tobacco giant Philip Morris USA, part of the Altria 
group. "It's a see-saw market," admitted Henk Potts, an analyst with 
Barclays Stockbrokers. "The market is trading very much on the headlines." 
Given the general market chaos over the Iraq war, It was difficult 
to pinpoint an exact reason for the bounce-back, he said, beyond individual 
trading decisions. "People are always interested in looking at the 
market in volatile times. There is interest in the market, in buying 
back some of the sold positions," he said. However Potts warned that 
the rally might not last. "We are still paying the price for the over-exuberant 
rally two weeks ago," he said. "I still think that the short-term 
outlook is on the down side." In Asia, the news had been mixed, with 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropping around 0.4 percent, while Japanese 
prices closed 0.18 percent higher on fresh demand associated with 
the country's new fiscal year. Among individual shares, tobacco firms 
were the big losers following concerns in the United States over the 
Philip Morris lawsuit. The firm has been ordered to post a 12-billion-dollar 
bond while it appeals against a March 22 court order to pay huge damages 
for misleading smokers about the dangers of light cigarettes over 
the past 30 years. Analysts have warned that the firm could have big 
problems raising so much money, and may even have to file for bankruptcy 
unless it can lower the bond. In London, tobacco firms were punished 
in the light of the decision. Gallagher slipped 2.3 percent to 596.2 
pence, Imperial Tobacco fell 1.1 percent to 993.5 pence and British 
American Tobacco dipped 1.0 percent to 585.5 pence. pw/dr/hd Stocks-Europe

China's Shanghai B-shares closed 0.27 percent higher Tuesday boosted 
by positive sentiment on the A-share market, dealers said. The Shanghai 
B-share index gained 0.33 points to 122.8 on turnover of 9.8 million 
dollars. The A-share index rose 12.65 points or 0.8 percent to 1,592.45 
on turnover of 11.68 billion yuan (1.41 million dollars). Shanghai 
B-shares recovered from their morning losses to finish fractionally 
higher, tracking strong gains seen in A-shares, dealers said. "In 
the wake of the strength of key blue chips in the A-share market, 
Shanghai B-shares largely ignored the 2002 net loss reported by Shangdong 
Airlines", said Wang Jun, analyst from Hai Tong Securities. A-shares 
in Shanghai Tuesday were driven higher by the sustained strength of 
blue chips such as China Merchants Bank, analysts said. They added 
that investors believe blue chips will be favored by qualified foreign 
institutional investors (QFII) who are expected to enter China's domestic 
markets as early as the first half of this year. Some analysts said 
that Shandong Airlines dampened B-shares partly after the carrier 
announced it booked a net loss of 45.58 million yuan for 2002, compared 
with a net profit of 54.94 million yuan a year earlier. China Textile 
Machinery led B-share gainers, rising one cent or 1.73 percent to 
close at 58.9 US cents. Shanghai Matsuoka saw the largest decrease 
among B-shares, losing 2.1 cents or 1.92 percent to close at 107.4 
US cents. The composite A- and B-share index closed 11.97 points up 
to 1,522.55. bur/dv Stocks-China

Vietnam's finance minister has proposed the National Assembly should 
add motorcycles to a list of goods subjected to taxes of between 20 
and 50 percent, a ministry official said here Tuesday. The proposals 
threatens to raise protests from foreign motorcycle makers, some of 
whom had to stop local production last year due to a sudden change 
of government policy on the importation of parts kits. Nguyen Sinh 
Hung told a conference of full-time National assembly deputies in 
Hanoi on Monday that raising tax rates for motorbikes should enable 
Vietnam to pledge to the tariff reductions set by the ASEAN Free Trade 
Area (AFTA) agreement. It would also allow the government to keep 
the number of motorbikes in the country to around 13 million in the 
coming years, he added. Hung was quoted in Vietnam News Agency (VNA) 
as saying the National assembly Standing Committee suggested a tax 
rate of 50 percent be applied on luxury motorbikes and 20 percent 
for popular motorbikes. The new parliamentary session is due to open 
on May 3 in Hanoi. If adopted, the decison is likely to intensify 
protests from motorcycle producers, who have been at loggerheads with 
the authorities for six months. The stand-off began in September last 
year when the trade ministry announced it was slashing the number 
of parts kits that bike assemblers could import during the year from 
2.5 million to 1.5 million. Assembly lines at Honda's plant ground 
to a halt in September and Yamaha followed suit in October after running 
out of parts kits. The government ended the dispute in November by 
allowing the importation of another 185,000 motorcycle kits. But the 
government upset the industry again early January, when it changed 
it import tax system on motorcycle component parts to levy a flat 
50 percent for motorbike parts and 100 percent for fully-assembled 
bikes. dla/ltl/bro Vietnam-auto

Ireland's main opposition party Fine Gael plans to ask the country's 
parliament to fund more humanitarian aid in Iraq, a spokesman said 
Tuesday. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny has written to the leaders of 
all political parties seeking support for a parliamentary motion for 
new funding, the spokesman said. The motion, which does not specify 
how much extra cash should be given, also calls on the government 
to ensure that the United Nations plays the lead role in dealing with 
the humanitarian situation in Iraq, the spokesman said. The Irish 
government last week allocated five million euros (5.3 million dollars) 
in aid for Iraq from the country's 23 million euro (25 million dollars) 
global humanitarian assistance budget. ab/pk/yad Iraq-war-Ireland-aid

Finnair, Finland's state-controlled flag carrier, warned Tuesday it 
would post a full-year operating loss, saying an extensive cost-cutting 
program launched last week would not begin to take effect before 2004. 
Finnair said it would look for short-term savings with maximum six-week 
temporary layoffs, beginning at the earliest in May. It said it aimed 
to implement the layoffs as quickly and widely as possible without 
significantly cutting the level of operations. "The warning was not 
a big surprise as (the) market situation is very weak for airlines, 
in addition the second quarter is decisive for Finnair's full-year 
result and we are already in April," analyst Bengt Dahlstroem at Conventum 
Securities told AFP's financial news subsidiary AFX News. Airlines 
worldwide have been hard hit as a result of the terrorist attacks 
in the United States in 2001 and the slump in air travel due to the 
global economic downturn, a situation further exacerbated by the Iraq 
war. Last week, Finnair announced it would cut 10 percent of its costs, 
some 160 million euros, and over 10 percent of its staff, about 1,200 
employees, but added that these measures would not begin to take effect 
before next year. In 2002, Finnair registered a net profit of 36.8 
million euros, up from 7.1 million the year earlier, on sales of 1.63 
billion euros, unchanged from 2001. Following the news Finnair's share 
price slid 4.49 percent on Monday's closing price, selling at 3.44 
euros on the Helsinki stock exchange. paa/po/hd Finland-air-company-results-Finnair

Hundreds of police and paramilitary troops patrolled the southern 
Pakistani town of Kashmoor Tuesday as tensions simmered over the killing 
of 14 people in a tribal feud, police said. Most shops and markets 
remained closed in Kashmoor, a remote town at the junction of Punjab, 
Sindh and Baluchistan provinces, where over a dozen gunmen killed 
14 people and injured 20 on Monday. "The situation is tense and police 
and rangers are patrolling the city as part of preventive measures," 
local police officer Tahir Nasir told AFP by telephone. A long-standing 
feud between the Mazari and Bugti tribes erupted on Monday when more 
than a dozen heavily armed Bugti tribesmen drove up to the home of 
an elder of the Mazari clan, Sohrab Khan, and opened fire, killing 
Khan and several associates. As they fled the assailants also fired 
at a nearby bus stand, causing more casualties. Among the dead was 
a child shot dead at the bus stand, provincial police chief Syed Kamal 
Shah said. Witnesses said hundreds of angry Mazari tribesmen were 
prowling the streets late Monday demanding the arrest of the attackers. 
They blocked the national highway and burnt tyres on the road. Fighting 
between Mazaris and Bugtis, influential tribes from Baluchistan, disrupted 
key gas pipelines and severed gas supplies to northern and eastern 
Pakistan in January and February when rockets used in the battles 
ruptured the pipelines. mz/bc/sdm/th Pakistan-clash

Hong Kong share prices closed 0.44 percent lower on Tuesday due to 
continued fears about the rapid spread of a killer virus, dealers 
said. The key Hang Seng index lost 37.56 points to close at 8,596.89 
on turnover of 8.49 billion Hong Kong dollars (1.1 billion US). Dealers 
said the downside narrowed at the market close after the government 
rejected rumours it will declare Hong Kong an infected area. "Market 
sentiment was very weak because of the fears over SARS (Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome)... there were also rumours that the government 
may declare Hong Kong an infected area," said Francis Lun, general 
manager of Fulbright Securities. "There was a bit of rebound towards 
the market close after the government rejected the rumours, but the 
Hang Seng index should continue to trade on a downward bias," he said. 
The rumours have also prompted residents to flock supermarkets for 
food provisions, but Health Secretary Margaret Chan said: "I wish 
to inform the people that Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
categorically has no plan and no need to declare an infected area." 
The rumours coincided with April Fool's Day. Amsteel Securities executive 
director Freddie Kwan said he expects the Hang Seng to see near-term 
support at about 8,200 points. "Sharp declines are unlikely in the 
near term, given that the local market has been heavily oversold in 
the previous trading sessions," Kwan said. Among property stocks, 
Cheung Kong was unchanged at 43.20 dollars, Sun Hung Kai Properties 
was flat at 37.40 dollars and New World Development was unchanged 
at 2.675 dollars. Wharf was down 2.00 dollars at 13.50 dollars after 
reporting weaker-than-expected results. Among financials, HSBC was 
flat at 80.25 dollars, Hang Seng Bank down 50 cents at 79.00 dollars 
and BOC Hong Kong down 10 cents at 8.05 dollars. In telecoms stocks, 
China Mobile was up 12 cents at 15.25 dollars, Hutchison added 60 
cents to 43.10 dollars and PCCW up 10 cents at 4.50 dollars. China 
Unicom was flat at 4.275 dollars. Oil stocks continued to outperform 
the market, with PetroChina up one cent at 1.65 dollars, CNOOC was 
up five cents at 10.45 dollars and Sinopec up one cents at 1.57 dollars. 
Aviation stocks were volatile on continuing concerns over the SARS 
impact, dealers said. Cathay Pacific was up 15 cents at 9.65 dollars 
and China Southern was flat at 1.73 dollars. bur/pl/dv Stocks-HongKong

The US-led war against Irag is likely to push North Korea to develop 
nuclear weapons, a Russian deputy foreign minister said Tuesday. "Unfortunately 
the Iraqi situation is driving the North Koreans to strengthen their 
defences," the Interfax news agency quoted Alexander Losyukov as saying. 
Asked if he meant that North Korea would seek to acquire nuclear weapons, 
Losyukov replied that "this is absolutely clear, and the absence of 
a negotiating process significantly increases this danger." Russia 
is trying to organise direct talks between North Korea and the United 
States over the crisis concerning North Korea's nuclear programme. 
Washington has rejected such talks, saying that an agreement must 
be found jointly by all regional powers. On Monday Losyukov called 
on South Korea to provide a "sobering influence" on the United States 
in the nuclear standoff with the Communist North. Speaking after talks 
in Moscow with Ra Jong-Yil, the senior advisor for national security 
to South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun, Losyukov said that only direct 
negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington could resolve the crisis.

Croatia's world champion skier Ivica Kostelic and his girlfriend, 
American racer Caroline Lalive, who is recovering in Croatia from 
injuries, have gone their separate ways, they said Tuesday. "It's 
true that Caroline and I have broke up," Kostelic said. The couple 
have kept their relationship alive from afar, with long phone calls 
and have been meeting mostly at ski events and during Lalive's visits 
to Croatia since they started dating 15 months ago. Last week 24-year-old 
Lalive arrived in the tourist resort of Selce at the invitation of 
Ivica and Janica Kostelic to recover from the injuries she sustained 
in the last World Cup race. "I broke up with Ivica and for several 
reasons. It is hard to sustain a relationship from afar and also I 
had this serous injury," said Lalive. Lalive is keeping company in 
Selce with Kostelic's superstar sister Janica who is recovering from 
knee surgery. str-zbl/ak Ski-CRO-USA-Kostelic-People

Israeli Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz on Tuesday threw down a warning 
to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad about the might of the Jewish 
state as tensions between the two neighbours rose. "President Bashar 
al-Assad knowns the might and the force of Israel in all areas, including 
the military," said Mofaz. Mofaz was reacting to remarks made by the 
Syrian leader to the Lebanese daily al-Safir last week that "as long 
as Israel exists, the threat (against) Israel will exist". "These 
remarks are all the more serious as they come at a time when it transpires 
that the Syrians are helping Iraq, as US leaders have revealed," said 
Mofaz. On Monday, a senior Israeli army intelligence officer charged 
that Iraqi missiles, possibly armed with chemical and biological warheads, 
may be hidden in Syria. General Yossi Kupperwasser's remarks came 
a day after US Secretary of State Colin Powell warned both Syria and 
Iran to stop what he called their backing for terrorists, saying Syria 
in particular faces a "critical choice." "Syria can continue direct 
support for terrorist groups and the dying regime of Saddam Hussein, 
or it can embark on a different and more hopeful course," Powell said. 
Last Friday US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warned the two states 
to steer clear of the Iraq war, saying that military supplies allegedly 
crossing from Syria were a "hostile act". In December, Israeli Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon said he had information indicating that Iraq 
had transferred weapons of mass destruction to Syria. The Israeli 
daily Haaretz said Tuesday that "in the last few days Damascus has 
expedited the passge of volunteers wishing to join the Iraqis in their 
war against the Americans". Despite the US warnings not to align itself 
with Iraq, a spokesman for the Syrian foreign ministry swore support 
for the Iraqi people against the invaders. "Syria has chosen to align 
itself with the brotherly Iraqi people who are facing an illegal and 
unjustified invasion and against whom are being committed all sorts 
of crimes against humanity," the spokesman said. Arab League Secretary 
General Amr Mussa on Monday voiced concern that the Iraq war could 
spill over and destabilise the entire Middle East. jlr/jh/kir Iraq-war-Israel-Syria

All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu has been forced to take a four-week break 
from rugby after a flare-up of his chronic kidney problem. "Jonah's 
health is paramount and his doctors have recommended that he take 
a full break from rugby so that he can receive the appropriate medical 
treatment," New Zealand Rugby Union deputy chief executive Steve Tew 
said Tuesday. "Our aim is to help Jonah get back to full health and 
back on the rugby field." He was replaced at half-time in Hurricanes' 
24-14 win over the Chiefs last week. The 27-year-old was diagnosed 
as having nephrotic syndrome, a rare and serious kidney disorder, 
at the end of 1996 and he has been receiving regular treatment. "This 
is a chronic intermittent condition which has fluctuated over the 
last six or seven years," Mayhew said. "We are hopeful that the modifications 
in his treatment will enable him to return to rugby in the near future. 
We will re-evaluate the situation after four weeks." All Blacks coach 
John Mitchell said everyone hoped to see Lomu back soon. "We wish 
him well in his recovery," he said. Lomu, rugby's biggest star since 
shooting to fame as a 19-year-old at the 1995 World Cup, missed an 
entire season after initially having the problem diagnosed. His form 
has fluctuated since coming back and he has been in and out of the 
New Zealand All Black and Hurricane Super 12 sides. But he looked 
to be back to his best on the All Blacks tour of Europe last November, 
scoring twice in the defeat to England. mjf/rw/ak RugbyU-NZL-Lomu

AS-SALIYAH, Qatar, April 1 (AFP) - US troops shot dead seven women 
and children at a checkpoint in central Iraq, US officials said Tuesday, 
as Baghdad came under a fresh wave of bombing targeting Saddam Hussein's 
hold on power. The shooting came after a night of intense bombardments 
on Baghdad, where four divisions of President Saddam Hussein's elite 
Republican Guard were dug in to defend the capital from any ground 
attack by US and British forces. Saddam's main presidential palace 
complex in the Iraqi capital, a potent symbol of his 24-year rule, 
came under fresh bombardment on Tuesday for the second consecutive 
day, an AFP reporter said. The palace grounds have been a frequent 
target in the bombing. US forces meanwhile stepped up military operations 
south of Baghdad ahead of an expected major push on the Iraqi capital. 
The checkpoint shooting occurred at Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) 
south of Baghdad on Monday afternoon, Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles 
Owens said at operational heaquarters in Qatar. The incident was thought 
likely to undermine efforts to win over the Iraqi people and counter 
international concern over the war. Owens said the victims, seven 
women and children, were in a civilian vehicle that failed to stop 
at the military post despite repeated warning shots fired by US troops. 
Four people in the vehicle escaped unharmed. The Washington Post reported 
that 10 civilians had been killed in the incident and quoted a US 
Army captain as saying that the casualties were sustained because 
US troops "didn't fire a warning shot soon enough." "You just (expletive) 
killed a family because you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough," 
US Army 3rd Division Captain Ronny Johnson was heard shouting over 
the radio to his men after the shooting stopped, the daily reported. 
In Qatar, Owens countered that: "As a last resort, they (US troops) 
fired into the passenger compartment of the vehicle," adding that 
an investigation had been opened. US forces have been on an increased 
state of alert following Saturday's suicide car-bombing, also near 
Najaf, that killed four US soldiers. A written statement issued by 
US Central Command said "initial reports indicate the soldiers responded 
in accordance with the rules of engagement to protect themselves." 
"In light of recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers 
exercised considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of 
life," it said. The shooting was expected to fuel vocal international 
opposition to the 13-day-old war, which the United States says it 
is waging with a constant eye on keeping civilian casualties to a 
minimum. Iraqi citizens living through nightly bombardments on Baghdad 
saw the capital come under a fresh and intense wave of bombing late 
Monday. Villagers on the edge of the capital reported 20 more civilians 
dead, 11 of them children, from the blitz. A plume of smoke rose into 
the air after a missile or smart bomb crashed into the heart of the 
presidential compound Tuesday. AFP reporters said the raids on Baghdad 
were growing more intense and that the barrage late Monday seemed 
to be the heaviest yet to have hit the battered city's downtown area. 
In Kuwait, air raid sirens sounded for the first time since Saturday. 
A defence ministry spokesman later said an Iraqi missile had been 
shot down over southern Iraq. The US Army's elite 101st Airborne division 
stepped up its campaign around Najaf after killing several opposition 
fighters and taking another 20 prisoner, military officials said. 
The "Screaming Eagles" began the third day of their campaign to secure 
the areas south and north of the Shiite Muslim holy city by sending 
in another battalion of Apache attack helicopters to support infantry 
troops. The 101st began its campaign around Najaf on March 30, with 
the primary aim of securing the area for communication and supply 
lines in the US military's push towards Baghdad. Najaf and Karbala, 
another Shiite pilgrimage city a further 80 kilometres closer to Baghdad, 
are considered vital to securing major routes to Baghdad. South of 
the capital, US troops massing for a decisive push towards Saddam's 
seat of power reported their first serious fighting with the Republican 
Guard, considered Iraq's most determined military unit and key to 
the defense of Baghdad. US officers said 200 Iraqis were killed, wounded 
or captured in the clashes which broke out overnight near Karbala, 
80 kilometers from Baghdad. Reports of the battle around Karbala came 
as US armoured units finalised plans for a decisive thrust toward 
Baghdad within a week, commanders said, with forces concentrated near 
Najaf, to the south. In Basra, seen as key to controling the southeast, 
British troops said they were waiting for reinforcements before making 
a final push to take the city. British commanders said 600 soldiers 
backed by tanks and armoured vehicles were battling to punch through 
the town of Abu Al Khasib, 20 kilometers to the southeast of Basra, 
as British artillery pounded Basra's western edge. An Iraqi military 
spokesman said at least 54 US and British soldiers had been killed 
in fighting since Sunday, most of them around Basra, with an unspecified 
number of others killed in other parts of Iraq. Officials in London 
said a British soldier was killed on duty in southern Iraq, taking 
to 26 the British death toll since the start of the war. US authorities 
say at least 39 US soldiers have been killed. In Amman, diplomatic 
sources said that Jordan supected Iraqi diplomats whom it expelled 
last month of plotting to poison water supplies serving military bases 
near the Iraqi border used by US service personnel. Jordanian authorities 
meanwhile arrested four Iraqis on suspicion of plotting to blow up 
a luxury Amman hotel frequented by US nationals and foreign journalists, 
diplomatic sources told AFP. Asian stock markets and the dollar paused 
to catch their breath following their latest slump but oil prices 
edged higher as worries over the impact of war continued to shake 
confidence. In Brussels, a diplomatic source said that US Secretary 
of State Colin Powell could hold discussions on Iraq with European 
Union foreign ministers on Thursday. In Russia, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Alexander Losyukov said the war was likely to fuel North Korea's nuclear 
ambitions. burs-jah/yad Iraq-worldwrap

An anti-aircraft shell fired from southern Lebanon landed near a school 
in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona on Tuesday, without 
exploding or causing any injuries, security officials said. The sources 
gave no more details on the sudden attack. On March 15, an anti-aircraft 
shell fired by Hezbollah Shiite guerrillas operating in southern Lebanon 
hit the main street in the northern town without exploding. Hezbollah 
said at the time its gunners had swung into action against "Israeli 
aircraft violating Lebanese air space close to the border". Hezbollah 
and Israeli forces dug in along the heavily defended border often 
engage in brief artillery duels, with Israeli fighter-bombers being 
used to swoop into Lebanese airspace. str-jlr/jh/dab Israel-Lebanon-Hezbollah

Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon appears to have ruled 
out manager Alex Ferguson making any big buys this summer. Kenyon, 
who announced reduced profits of 20.3 million pounds (32 million dollars) 
for the six months to the end of January, said United were unlikely 
to match the 30 million pound (47 million dollar) fee they paid Leeds 
United for England defender Rio Ferdinand last July. Ferguson has 
spent almost 80 million pounds (126 million dollars) on Ferdinand, 
Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron and Dutch striker Ruud van 
Nistelrooy over the past 18 months. And last month he hinted he was 
prepared to off-load players like Ryan Giggs to help finance another 
splurge in the transfer market. But Kenyon said Tuesday any more mammoth 
buys were out of the question. "Certainly from Manchester United's 
perspective we believe these kind of sums to buy players are a thing 
of the past," he said. "Hindsight is a wonderful thing but we are 
now seeing transfer prices come down. Buying Rio was the right decision 
at the time and it remains so. "He fitted into the right age profile 
and we look upon him as a long term investment. "We made the decision 
to buy him in light of our overall wage structure and transfer budget 
we set ourselves and we achieved those targets," he added. bur/rw/ak

India-based Myanmar activists asked New Delhi Tuesday to withdraw 
a long-pending case against a journalist from Myanmar who allegedly 
hijacked a plane. Around 150 people held a demonstration here to pressure 
the government to scrap the case against Soe Myint, the founder of 
Internet news agency Mizzima News, who is accused of commandeering 
the plane to draw attention to the plight of his people under Myanmar's 
military regime. The case is due to open Wednesday in the eastern 
state of West Bengal. In 1990 Soe Myint, along with another activist, 
diverted a Thai Airways Bangkok-Yangon flight to Calcutta, the capital 
of West Bengal. The activists say the two did not use violence during 
the incident and gave themselves up to the Indian authorities. No 
charges were made against them at the time and they were freed soon 
after. But 13 years later, the West Bengal government suddenly decided 
to revive the case against Myint last month and charged him with hijacking. 
Activists had previously claimed the charges were brought under pressure 
from Yangon. "If he is found guilty, he could get life imprisonment," 
said demonstrator Ko Moe. "Free Soe Myint; We need India's support," 
the protestors shouted. The other activist had left India long ago. 
In 1998 hundreds of thousands of people from Myanmar fled the country, 
then called Burma, during a crackdown by the regime after an uprising 
against 30-year-old military rule. According to estimates, there are 
more than 50,000 people from Myanmar living as refugees in India.

Five people are confirmed dead and 22 are missing after a mudslide 
triggered by heavy rain hit homes in the eastern Indonesian island 
of Flores, police said Tuesday. The residents were asleep when the 
mudslide -- triggered by a day-long storm -- swept through the Roworeke 
area near the town of Ende early Monday, a local policeman said. "The 
fifth body was found today and we fear the other 22 people are no 
longer alive," Brigadier Pius told AFP from Ende. He said the mudslide 
also destroyed a bridge on the road between Ende and Maumere. Another 
five people were killed last week when a cliff collapsed on them in 
the island after they fled their homes during an earthquake. vt/sm/sdm/th

South African newspapers took advantage of April Fools Day Tuesday 
to offer their readers some lighter coverage of the war in Iraq, including 
a report that Saddam Hussein has been offered asylum in South Africa. 
Johannesburg-based newspaper Beeld reported that President Thabo Mbeki 
had offered Saddam asylum and a senior post in the South African fuel 
industry, which would see the Iraqi leader administering South Africa's 
fuel prices. As part of the package Saddam would be offered a luxury 
game farm near the fuel producing town of Sasolburg in the Free State 
province, the Afrikaans-language daily wrote. Saddam would be flown 
from Iraq in Mbeki's presidential jet. Coalition aircraft would escort 
him to the edge of Iraqi airspace, but Saddam had insisted that a 
missile defence system be fitted to the jet, the paper wrote. The 
report said the Iraqi government would foot half the bill for the 
missile system. The US government was said to be excited about the 
offer because it would make Saddam "someone else's problem". The Sowetan 
newspaper, meanwhile, reported that South Africa was Saddam's "preferred 
destination" and Iraqi officials were in the country seeking suitable 
accommodation for their leader. "It is believed that several government 
guest houses in South Africa, normally reserved for visiting dignitaries, 
have already been examined by Iraqi protocol officicials as possible 
homes for their president," the newspaper said. Other newspapers jested 
about a change in the law that has forced South African motorists 
to convert their conventional drivers' licences into credit card form. 
The Pretoria News and the Johannesburg-based Star reported that cyclists 
now had six months to get a riding licence. "They (cyclists) will 
have to undergo an eye test as it is just as important for a cyclist 
to see a motor vehicle driver," a Transport Ministry spokesman was
